            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE Sermons being exactly penned from the Authors own mouth, are now brought to publique view, though when he preached them, had not the leaſt thought to ſuffer them to be Printed: but ſince they were thus prepared to come abroad into the world, the Pious Author finding ſo much of the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt in view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, could not turn his backe upon them.</p>
                  <p>As for this godly Author, his worth and excellency is ſo eminently known, it would be vanity in me to ſpeake any thing in relation to his praiſe: let this, and other of his owne works praiſe him. Yet thus much I ſhall ſay, that I doe verily believe, that he preached theſe Choiſe Lectures from the boſome of Jeſus Chriſt, that theſe things were the very experiments of his owne ſoule, and the lively act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſpirit of God within him. What he hath ſeene and heard, hee hath declared, that we might have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, whoſe fellowſhip is with the Father and the <note place="margin">1 Iohn 1. 3.</note> Sonne, and therein ſhall our joy be full.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Sermons are not cloathed with humane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Art, quaint expreſſions, eloquent ſpeculations; but chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:53448:4"/> to come forth in the nakedneſſe of truth, not with the enticing words of mans wiſdome, but in the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit, and of power: here is nothing to fill thy head with barren notions, fruitleſſe opinions, or meer ſpeculations; but here is that to fill thy heart with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, the life of Chriſt, and light of his ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall in a few words hint out what thou ſhalt find in theſe enſuing diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a glorious diſcovery of a ſaving ſight of God in Chriſt. When <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee Gods face, the Lord himſelfe tels him, that no man can ſee his face, and live: Yet the Lord proclaimed his mercie, his patience, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, his truth, and his justice before him. Now where was <hi>Moſes</hi> all this while? he was in the clift of the <hi>rock:</hi> Now verily that <hi>Rock</hi> was Chriſt; we ſee the glory of God in Chriſt, <hi>per ſpeculum,</hi> as it were in a <hi>glaſſe.</hi> Chriſt is that glaſſe, in which wee ſee the image of the Fathers glory, and that as with <hi>open face.</hi> Christ is called the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18. Heb. 1. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>brightneſſe of his Father's glory:</hi> ſo that the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods glory is manifeſted by Chriſt, as the Sunne is manifeſted by it's boames: wee cannot ſee the Sunne in <hi>Rotà,</hi> in his Charret, or circumvolution, but by it's beames: ſo the Fathers glory is revealed. <hi>Tanquam per radios ac ſplendorem,</hi> as it were by beames and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhining moſt excellently in Chriſt. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God, who hath commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> God is known by Chriſt, as a man is known by his face; it is only hee that <hi>came from the boſome of the Father,</hi> that can open the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of his boſome, and reveale the glory and brightneſſe of Gods face unto us.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53448:4"/>
                  <p>Secondly, this glorious ſight of God is that, that humbles the ſoule: <hi>Becauſe mine eye hath ſeen thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) I abhor my ſelfe in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The greateſt piece of ſelf-denyall is to diſcard our own righteouſneſſe and formality.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Mans fleſhly righteouſneſſe is the great idoll of the world, every one is ready to fall downe unto it, and call it bleſſed. This is Anti-Chriſt comming forth in the habit of Chriſt, being arrayed and decked with gold, precious ſtones, and pearls, whereby the Nations are deceived: but when wee know the righteouſneſſe of the Lord, wee ſhall caſt away our owne righteouſneſſe, and (as the Prophet ſpeakes) ſay unto it, <hi>get yee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 30. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>hence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Formality is in no leſſe eſteeme among us then the former: what is the Religion of moſt people but a meere forme, without any life or power at all. Aſtronomers tell us, that the upper Planets have their <hi>Stations,</hi> and <hi>Retrogradations,</hi> as well as their direct <hi>Motions.</hi> So 'tis with moſt in their Religion, ſometimes they move forwards, ſometimes backward, ſometimes ſtand at a ſtay, and thus they tread always in one circle or round, turning like a doore upon the hinges, but never from off the place where they were. As for moſt mens hearing, praying, faſting, what is it, but as a taske, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo coldly, that there is no principle of divine life in it? and thus they goe on, but are never at their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end. Men commonly uſe what they ſhould enjoy, and enjoy that they ſhould uſe: they will uſe the Lord whom they ſhould enjoy, and they will enjoy their duties and performances, that they ſhould only uſe: and thus they ſtarve their ſoules by formality in religion.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53448:5"/>
                  <p>The third thing we may take notice of, is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt commended to us, before the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of <hi>Adam.</hi> Moſt of the worlds righteouſneſſe proceedes from the principles of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> which is corrupt and fleſhly; what is this but to be born of <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> the ſon of the bond-woman, to come unto <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> viz. the Covenant of works: but <hi>Jeruſalem which is above is free,</hi> which is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all the firſt-born of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of grace. Vain man thinks to climb to Heaven by his own righteouſneſſe, when alas! it is but of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> naturall, weake, and fleſhly. All the wiſdome, knowledg, invention of man, as Tongues, Arts, and Sciences; as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, Logicke, Rhetoricke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe are but to repaire thoſe reliques of the firſt <hi>Adam's</hi> corrupted principles of reaſon and underſtanding: therefore if wee goe to patch up a righteouſneſſe of theſe, we doe but build what the Lord will have deſtroyed. But that which is able to reſtore us, is an eſtabliſhment of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt upon our hearts, by the participation of the divine nature. Chriſt performs all righteouſneſſe for his Saints, and then works all righteouſneſſe in them: The divine will of God is righteouſneſſe, now Chriſt is that divine will, brought forth in a Saint, working after the Lords owne pleaſure. The Civill law doth account Elephants and Camels to have the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of wild beaſts, though they doe the worke of tame beaſts: So <hi>Adam's</hi> righteouſneſſe commends not to God, we are only <hi>accepted in the beloved, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or ingratiated through that</hi> beloved. The divine, treaſures of righteouſneſſe are firſt in Chriſt, and by our union with him wee come to enjoy them by way of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53448:5"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Subſtantiall and reall holineſſe ſet out to be farre more excellent then all empty formes, or mere profeſſions. Holineſſe is God, <hi>ſtamped</hi> and printed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoule: 'tis Chriſt <hi>formed</hi> in the heart: 'tis the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry image, frame, and diſpoſition of the holy ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us.</p>
                  <p>The Philoſopher could ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that God was but an empty name, without vertue: ſo are all our profeſſions of Chriſt without holineſſe, that being the very marrow and quinteſſence of all religion. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is ſomething of God in us, it proceed from him, it lives in him; God can no more be ſeparated from it, then the beames from the Sunne. Holineſſe is happineſſe, and the more of it we have, the more wee have of the life and image of God upon us. Holineſſe is nothing but our conformity to God, and our being like him, to be as he is: Holineſſe is the new frame, the new creation, the workmanſhip of the Lord in our hearts: it is the Lord building and ſetting up his owne Temple, Tabernacle, and new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> within us, filling of us with his owne glory, writing his name in our fore heads, by imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his owne divine image upon us. Oh what happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, what ſweet delight, and harmony of heart, what ſoule-muſicke, and ſpirituall joy is there in having our ſoule wrapt up in the divine life, light, and beauty of the Lords holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Thou haſt a diſcovery of the inability of mans carnall principles or reaſon to judge of ſpirituall things, or the things of God: every truth is diſcovered by principles of light ſuitable to it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that the Apoſtle tels us of, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an <hi>animate, ſenſual,</hi> or <hi>natural man:</hi> and of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb facs="tcp:53448:6"/> a ſpirituall man, one enlightned by the ſpirit of God. Now the naturall man is not able to judge of things above the principles of nature.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>no man knowes the things of a man, but the ſpirit of man which is in him.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The things of man are all created things, man is therefore ſaid to be, as it were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a <hi>little world,</hi> or an Epitome or Compendium wherein all created things are deſcribed, as in a mappe or ſhort abridgement. Now the principle of reaſon in mans heart is able to ſearch out the hidden things of nature. But this large principle of man is too narrow to ſearch into the things of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The things of God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11. 12. 14, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>no man, but the ſpirit of God. The ſpirit ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the deepe things of God.</hi> And againe he ſaith, <hi>The wiſdome of the ſpirit is but fooliſhneſſe to the naturall man.</hi> And why ſo, becauſe ſaith hee, <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> That is, they are to be underſtood in a ſpirituall ſenſe, to which, mans carnall reaſon cannot reach. But now ſaith hee, <hi>the ſpirituall man diſcerneth all things,</hi> ſo that divine things are only known by the ſpirit; 'tis the ſpirit of all truth that leads into all truth.</p>
                  <p>Then 'tis not all Maximes and rules, 'tis not ſyllogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall reaſonings and diſputes, 'tis not Bookes and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, 'tis not all Syſtems and Bodies of Divinity that can reveal the ſecret myſteries of truth; but it is the work of the ſpirit: for the myſtery of Chriſt is not meerly letter and forme without us, but a quickning ſpirit within us. Yet</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Wee are taught, that there is a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, ſpirituall reaſoning in godlineſſe; and that it
<pb facs="tcp:53448:6"/> is the higheſt act of the minde, which is the higheſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the ſoule. The mind of a Saint is Gods Throne, and the motions of the mind, or the reaſonings thereof is nothing but Chriſt, ſwaying the ſoule according to his good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>It's true, that reaſon as tis in man, is a moſt imperfect and weak light, and fals ſhort of the light of God, being depraved, and mixt with much darkneſſe, and ſo is unſuitable to judge divine things: but reaſon conſidered in it's height and excellency is no other then Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſpirit: then ſo much as reaſon hath of the light of God, ſo much it hath of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Then the moſt excellent, the moſt ſupreame, and the ſublimeſt reaſon is in godlineſſe, becauſe in it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt cleareneſſe, certainety, and light. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls it <hi>demonſtration;</hi> now divine reaſon is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, which is an evidencing of things by the cleareſt, ſureſt, and moſt irreſiſtible light that can be. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> is this ſpirituall reaſon, for ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>that which manifeſts is light,</hi> Eph. 5. 13. And what is that light but Chriſt and his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given thee a taſt of things, to ſet an edge to thy appetite, that thou mayeſt make a fuller meal of Divine Dainties by reading the enſuing Treatiſe, where thou haſt a Table richly ſpread. Now if thou art one of CHRISTS Friends, then come and <hi>eate of this honey, and drinke of this wine, yea eate and drinke abundantly, O beloved.</hi> Here thou maiſt eate and not ſurfet; here thou maiſt drinke, and not be drunken: the more thou eateſt, the ſtronger will thy appetite be; and the more thou drinkeſt, the more thou wilt thirſt, and yet with the greateſt ſaturati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſent.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53448:7"/>
                  <p>To conclude, Thou mayeſt find much of CHRIST in this Booke; but ſee alſo whether thou canſt finde much of him alſo in thine owne heart. Now that theſe things, which are here written with Paper and Inke, may bee written upon the Table of thy ſoule by the finger of the Spirit, is the prayer of him, who is</p>

                     <epigraph>
                        <q>

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this verſe we have a deſcription of true <hi>Goſpell humiliation,</hi> (the moſt that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> wrote was <hi>Goſpell,</hi> he was an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall Prophet) and in that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription there are theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt the <hi>occaſion</hi> of this great <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">God hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth his Miniſters ere he ſend them.</note> of the Prophet; and that was that God was now ſetting him forth in the Goſpell, to preach the will of God to the People.
<q>
                           <p>God when he ſends Miniſters to his worke, he doth firſt humble them.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>They can never doe any thing to purpoſe for God till they be undone, <hi>Woe is me I am undone</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) in this verſe, and then in the verſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing God ſends him to preach; So that the maine cauſe why you have not Miniſters, <hi>according to God,</hi> that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53448:12"/> he doth not bleſſe their worke, according to your heart and deſire, it is not for want of <hi>parts</hi> or <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> or for want of Parts or <hi>degrees,</hi> or the like: but the generall, the maine cauſe is, becauſe they are not <hi>humbled,</hi> God hath not <hi>undone</hi> them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is the humiliation it ſelf, which conſiſts,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, of an Act of the Underſtanding, whereby the Prophet ſaw ſome thing more then he knew before, and cries out I am <hi>undone;</hi> he thought he was in a good condition before; but now he doth not meerly ſay I am <hi>undone,</hi> but <hi>woe</hi> is me, <hi>woe</hi> is me I am <hi>undone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, there is the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of it and the cauſes are twofold.</p>
                     <p>One is materiall (as you call it) that is ſin, <hi>woe is me I am undone,</hi> Why? Becauſe <hi>I am a man,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> Indeed, a <hi>man</hi> as a <hi>man</hi> will be undone if <note place="margin">Sin, a cauſe of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note> he ſee the <hi>glory</hi> of God, if he were not a Sinner: But ſaith he, <hi>becauſe I am a man of uncleane lips, and becauſe I dwell among a People of uncleane lips.</hi> Becauſe I ſee I have many ſinns, and becauſe I ſee them; now the leaſt ſin is exceeding ſinfull, even to <hi>dwell</hi> among <hi>wicked</hi> people, a man cannot chooſe but be tainted with them: Therefore <hi>woe is me I am undone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other cauſe is in theſe words, <hi>I have ſeene the King the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> For a man may have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough and yet never be humbled or undone; as you know, wicked men now have, and men, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, <note place="margin">The ſight of God a humbling ſight.</note> for <hi>ever</hi> will have hereafter in <hi>Hell,</hi> and yet they will never be humbled, they will never be <hi>undone</hi> in this ſence: but there was this thing to make it up, <hi>mine eyes have ſeene the King, the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> as wee ſee in the verſe before in the Viſion, how he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53448:12"/> had ſeene the Lord. So now we come to theſe words.
<q>
                           <p>For mine eyes have ſeene the King, the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>From which words you are to obſerve two things. The firſt is this, that</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is the peculiar priviledge of the Saints and ever was, and ever will be, to ſee God, to ſee the King, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that
<q>
                           <p>A true ſaving ſight of the Lord of Hoſts, of God in Chriſt Jeſus, is that principally, that undoes men, or truly and ſavingly humbles men.</p>
                        </q>

                     <p>I ſhall ſpeak more particulerly of the latter, but we cannot well underſtand the latter, without we have a little underſtanding in the former. For if you would know how the ſight of God humbleth men, you muſt underſtand a little what this ſight, what this ſeeing of God is.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall ſpeake briefly of the former Leſſon which is this, that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Saints, to ſee God.</note>
                        <q>
                           <p>It is a peculiar priviledge of a Saint, and ever was, and ever will he, to ſee God, to ſee the King of Glory the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wee doe not now ſpeak of the ſight of God, that we call the beatificall Viſion, that ſight of God we ſhall have in Heaven: for every one of you know that wicked men ſhall never <hi>ſee</hi> God that way, But I ſay there is a <hi>ſight</hi> of God in this <hi>world,</hi> that every <note place="margin">A ſight of God in this world.</note> 
                        <hi>Saint</hi> in all Ages hath had, and no other Sonne or Daughter of man from the beginning to the end ever <hi>had,</hi> or <hi>ſhal</hi> have but thoſe that are reall S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi>. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſight, or ſeeing of God, we meane to ſpeak, if

                           </gap> 1, Corporeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> know that there are divers ſorts of <hi>ſights</hi> of God: Men are ſaid many wayes to ſee God. As</p>
                     <p>Firſt, there is a corporeall ſight, a <hi>bodilie</hi> ſight of God, a ſeeing of God with <hi>bodilie</hi> eyes: and ſo the Scripture doth often ſpeak negatively, that <hi>No man hath ſeene God at any time that way;</hi> no man hath <hi>ſeene</hi> his ſhape; that is no man in this world with <hi>bodilie</hi> eyes did ever <hi>ſee</hi> God, as though he were a body, or a <hi>corporeall</hi> ſubſtance. Indeed men have ſeen <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who was God; and Chriſt Jeſus ſaith, <hi>Joh. 6, 36. Yee have ſeene me and heard me, and yet you believe not in me. So that the Phariſees,</hi> the proud Phariſees that never were humbled ſaw Jeſus Chriſt, that was God. But yet that is not the <hi>ſight</hi> here ſpoken of, that peculiar ſight which none but Saints have: For the former no man ever had; and the latter, wicked men have as well as good; that is, <hi>wicked</hi> men ſaw Chriſt bodily as well as <hi>good</hi> men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is an other ſight of God; that is, we <note place="margin">2. In works of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> may be ſaid to ſee God in his <hi>works</hi> of creation, or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;</hi> or rather to ſpeak more properly, we ſee the <hi>things</hi> of God; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. they ſaw <hi>the inviſible things of God, in the things that were made;</hi> that is, a <hi>naturall</hi> man may <hi>ſee</hi> a great <hi>power</hi> in that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which made the <hi>Moone,</hi> and great <hi>Wiſdome</hi> in him that contrived the <hi>Sun, Moone, Stars,</hi> and all creatures from the beginning. Now I ſay this may be ſaid to be a ſeeing, or a knowing of God: for in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. as it is ſaid in one place, they <hi>ſaw the inviſible things of God;</hi> ſo afterwards it is ſaid, <hi>they knew God, who, becauſe they knew God, and glorified him not as God, God gave them up</hi> &amp;c. There was ſome thing, ſome faſhion that they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53448:13"/> did ſee God in the <hi>creation,</hi> in the creatures, but this ſight of God is not that I meane to ſpeak of, that <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> ſight of which Chriſt ſpeakes <hi>Math. 5. Bleſſed are the pure in heart: for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, (beſides the corporeall ſeeing, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <note place="margin">3. By com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</note> ſeeing) there is a <hi>ſight</hi> of God by the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods ſpirit. I ſay, Gods ſpirit may raiſe a man up to <hi>ſee</hi> things, which no man naturally ever did, or could; yet it is not this ſight. Now indeed, that more properly (as I ſaid of the former) is to ſee the things of God: Only the former is a ſeeing of the things of God in the <hi>creature;</hi> and this is a ſeeing the things of God in the Goſpel. So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. where mention is made of Hypocrites, that fall away and are damned; it is ſaid, <hi>they taſted of the heavenly gift, and were enlightened:</hi> for there is the very word. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare that with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. In the one, we read they were <hi>enlightned,</hi> and after fell off. In the other, wee read that by the knowledge of Chriſt, they were <hi>cleanſed,</hi> and after fell, <hi>with the Dog to his Vomit.</hi> I ſay, there is a <hi>Goſpell</hi> ſight of God, that hath ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of this <hi>peculier</hi> priviledge, but is not it. Men may have a ſight to know abundance of things, of the Kingdome of God; and ſo in a ſort be ſaid to know, and to ſee God, yet this is not the <hi>peculiar</hi> ſight I am to ſpeak of.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, there is a ſight of God, which is not pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>culiar <note place="margin">4. At the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to the Saints; and that is at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; there, <hi>wicked</hi> people ſhall ſee God. Only, they ſhall ſee him clothed with wrath, they ſhall ſee the Lord coming out to judgement againſt them; they ſhall ſee that <hi>Man,</hi> that they thought to be <hi>but</hi> a man,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53448:14"/> and no more, whom they crucified; they ſhall then ſee him, God, comming to judge the world; they <hi>ſhal ſee him whom they have pierced:</hi> And this is not that ſight, that is the priviledge of Saints. It is not a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall ſight, as the <hi>Jews</hi> had; nor it is not a common ſight as the <hi>Heathens</hi> have by the <hi>creation,</hi> or as <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi> have in the <hi>Goſpell</hi> by <hi>illumination;</hi> or as <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi> ſhall have one day to their <hi>condemnation.</hi> It is none of theſe <hi>ſights.</hi> But</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, and laſtly, there is a <hi>ſeeing</hi> of God in the <note place="margin">A peculiar Goſpell ſight only to Saints.</note> 
                        <hi>Goſpell,</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, which is peculiar only to the <hi>People</hi> of God. There was no Saint that ever was in the world, but had this ſight, more or leſſe. There were few Saints in the old Teſtament, but ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where or other it is mentioned, and ſaid of them, that they ſaw God; either directly, or by conſequence. As <note place="margin">In the old Teſtament.</note> for inſtance in the old Teſtament, in the beginning of it (though in a different manner) you read of divers men that are ſaid to be walkers with God, As <hi>Noah</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Noah. Henoch. Abraham.</note> 
                        <hi>walked with God,</hi> and <hi>Henoch walked with God,</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham walked with God.</hi> Now it is impoſſible, in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, right ſence, that you can conceive of men to walk with God, hand in hand, but it muſt neceſſarily imply, that they did ſee God, <hi>how ſhall two walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unleſſe they be agreed?</hi> much leſſe, unleſſe they <hi>ſee</hi> one another; for a man will not walk with one which he ſees not. Therefore it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Joh. 8. 58. Abraham ſaw my day, and rejoyced..</hi> He did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee the <hi>time,</hi> (for that is not all) but he ſaw the <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of God in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> though he were not yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted. <note place="margin">Moſes</note> So <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo had this ſight, as we read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 27. It is ſaid, <hi>by faith he forſook Aegypt, not fearing the wrath of the King: for he endured, as ſeeing</hi>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53448:14"/> 
                        <hi>him who is inviſible. Moſes</hi> ſaw him, who is inviſible: God is ſaid to be <hi>inviſible,</hi> two wayes; he is <hi>inviſible</hi> in reſpect of any <hi>corporeall</hi> ſhape: And God is ſaid to be <hi>inviſible,</hi> in reſpect of all <hi>mankind,</hi> beſides the <hi>Saints:</hi> he ſaw him who is inviſible, he ſaw him whom never man <hi>ſaw,</hi> or ſhall <hi>ſee,</hi> but only thoſe that are in Chriſt, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was. Of <hi>Solomon</hi> it is ſaid, <note place="margin">Solomon.</note> God appeared twice to him; God appeared often to <hi>Saul:</hi> therefore <hi>Saul</hi> thought it ſtrange, when the Lord <hi>appeared</hi> not unto him; But God did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to <hi>Saul</hi> in all his dayes, with ſuch an appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">Iſaiah.</note> and in that faſhion as he did to <hi>Solomon.</hi> So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the Text, he had a peculiar ſight that made him cry out, <hi>Woe is me, I am undone: for mine eyes have ſeene the King, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> It was common in the <hi>old Teſtament;</hi> and in the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> it is every where ſpoken of; you ſhall read of it more fully in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> than in the <hi>Old.</hi> In <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 52. 8. it was propheſied concerning the new Teſtament; <note place="margin">In the new Teſtament.</note> 
                        <hi>Thy watchmen ſhall lift up their voyce; for they ſhall ſee eye to eye, when the Lord ſhall bring againe Zion.</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith 2 <hi>Cor. 3. We all behold with open face.</hi> There was a kind of <hi>vaile,</hi> over the beſt of them in the <hi>old;</hi> though it were a peculiar thing to the S<hi rend="sup">ts.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Paul.</note> then to ſee God, yet now in the <hi>new</hi> Teſtament (though the ſight be the ſame,) yet it is a great deale <hi>clearer,</hi> and <hi>brighter,</hi> and <hi>nearer,</hi> and more <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> As to give you a few inſtances; as that of <hi>Paul 2 Cor.</hi> 12. He was <hi>wrapped up into the third heaven, into Paradice,</hi> where he heard wonders that were not to be uttered. What were thoſe glorious things that he <hi>ſaw,</hi> that he could not utter? Without controverſie, the ſame that <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw, <hi>Act. 7. The Heavens were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Stephen.</note>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53448:15"/> 
                        <hi>and he ſaw Chriſt at the right hand of God,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of God in <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> And leaſt you ſhould think it was a thing peculiar to <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Stephen,</hi> it is a thing commonly ſpoken of in the new teſtament, of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Saints;</hi> and when Chriſt on the Mount ſaith, <note place="margin">And al the Saints,</note> 
                        <hi>bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God Mat. 5. without holines none ſhall ſee God. Heb.</hi> 12. As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>any</hi> man that is <hi>holy</hi> ſhall <hi>ſee</hi> God. In 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. A man that lives in ſin, hath not <hi>ſeene</hi> God. And <hi>he that loves not his Brother, hath not ſeene God.</hi> It is a common thing, it <hi>is,</hi> it <hi>hath</hi> been, and it <hi>ſhall</hi> be, the <hi>Saints,</hi> and all the Saints have a peculiar ſight of God that the world knowes not of.</p>
                     <p>To open it a little further, (that hearing that there is ſuch a glorious thing, you may look after it, and ſet your minds to conſider it,) I ſhall indeavour it as far as I may, according to Scripture, becauſe there is nothing but the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> that can diſcover this.</p>
                     <p>You will ſay, <hi>what</hi> is this ſight? Or <hi>how</hi> is it? Or <hi>how</hi> ſhall we underſtand it? <note place="margin">This ſight of God which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saints have, is</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will lay before you theſe 4 or 5 propoſitions in generall, that you may have a little light of it out of the ſcriptures.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is this; that the <hi>ſight</hi> of God, which the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Imperfect.</note> have in this world, it is but imperfect, it is but in part it is not <hi>ful,</hi> &amp; <hi>compleat,</hi> until they be in <hi>heaven.</hi> Not that I meane that they ſee ſome <hi>part</hi> of God in this world, and they ſhall ſee him <hi>all</hi> in the other world. No, a Saint ſeeth God wholly here; he ſees all that is in God; he ſees his <hi>love,</hi> he ſees his <hi>power,</hi> he ſees his <hi>ſtrength,</hi> he ſees his <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> he ſees his mercy; he ſees his all <hi>Attributes</hi> far otherwiſe then a <hi>carnall</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53448:15"/> man can; and that with redundancie, with ſome thing more then a meere, or bare <hi>knowing</hi> of his <hi>Attributes,</hi> though he ſee and know every one of thoſe, and every particle of thoſe, otherwiſe then the <hi>world</hi> ſees them; (ſo my meaning is,) yet he ſees in part, that is, he knows not any of theſe things perfectly. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 9. Wee know in part, but hereafter we ſhall know as we are known.</hi> Which words, (as I conceive) point not out principally Spirituall things, that we know the <hi>will</hi> of God in <hi>part</hi> here, but we ſhall know his will perfectly in Heaven, (though that be true;) for (it may be) it is not neceſſarie, that we ſhould know the will of God ſo here: For then (it may be) we ſhould have more glorious <hi>Principles.</hi> But the meaning is, here we know little of God; we know him in <hi>part;</hi> but he knows us <hi>wholly:</hi> But when we ſhall come to Heaven, we ſhall know God, as he kows us, therefore that brake the Apoſtles heart, and made him ſigh <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. that he would have given all the world if he had had it, that he might <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend</hi> him, that <hi>comprehended</hi> him. As if he had ſaid, God ſees me <hi>clearly,</hi> and groundedly, all the thoughts of my heart, but I cannot <hi>apprehend</hi> God, as he doth me. Therefore, becauſe this ſeeing of God is but in part in this World, becauſe we ſee but <hi>little,</hi> it is oft in Scripture called, a <hi>not</hi> ſeeing. As in 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 1. Now we are the Sons of God, but it doth not yet appeare what we ſhall be: but when he ſhall appeare we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> As if he had ſaid, that <hi>ſight</hi> that we have of him now, it is <hi>ſcarce</hi> worth the calling a ſight, So in 1 <hi>Pet. 1. VVhom having not ſeene, yet ye love.</hi> And in <hi>Rom. 8. If we did ſee, why doe we yet hope for it? for hope is of that which is not ſeene.</hi> There is no Saint that can love
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53448:16"/> God, but he muſt ſee God: But the meaning of thoſe phraſes is, not that Saints ſee not God, but they ſee ſo little, in compariſon of what they ſhall ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that it may well be called not ſeeing; they love God, though they have not gotten that perfect ſight of God, that one day they ſhall have. Indeed they ſhall have a <hi>perfect</hi> ſight, not only in reſpect of the degrees of ſeeing, but they ſhall have this addition alſo to it, that then they ſhall ſee God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> with their bodily eyes; as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know that my redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer liveth, and that I ſhal ſee God in my fleſh,</hi> And what <note place="margin">Job. 19. 1 Cor. 15.</note> that ſhall be, (when <hi>Chriſt ſhall deliver up the Kingdome to his Father)</hi> I know not. That is one propoſition to help us to underſtand this glorious priviledge, our ſeeing of God in this world is but in part.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that ſeeing him in part, whatſoever it is, <note place="margin">2 unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> it is an unſpeakable ſight; a ſight that no man is able to <hi>utter.</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he was <hi>taken up into the third Heaven, and heard words that could not be ſpoken;</hi> ſo doubtleſſe the Saints ſee things that cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, eye hath not ſeene, nor eare heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, thoſe things that God hath laid up for them that love him.</hi> Now if they were <hi>ſpeakable,</hi> demonſtrable things, a man might give ſome notions in writing; he might <hi>ſee,</hi> or <hi>ſpeak,</hi> or <hi>heare,</hi> or give ſome knowledge, he might conſider of it: but the <hi>tongue, eare,</hi> and <hi>eye,</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> of man, is not able to comprehend the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious priviledge, of the ſeeing the glory of God in Jeſus Chriſt, it is unſpeakable; Therefore as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks of the love of God, <hi>it paſſeth knowledge,</hi> not only of a carnall, worldly man, but of that man that hath it, it paſſeth <hi>his</hi> knowledge to <hi>comprehend</hi> it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53448:16"/> before God gives it, but if God doe but eclipſe it a little, he cannot <hi>comprehend</hi> what it was when he had it, though it were but yeſterday; and when he hath it, and hath moſt of it, he is not able to utter and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it. That is a ſecond propoſition concerning this glorious priviledge, it is <hi>imperfect,</hi> and it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable.</p>
                     <p>A third thing is this, that this glorious <hi>priviledge</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3. Only in Chriſt.</note> that the Saints have of ſeeing God, whatſoever that is, let it be more or leſſe, it is only in the <hi>face</hi> of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> For take any other ſight of God; take the <hi>corporeall</hi> ſight, the ſeeing of the <hi>man</hi> Chriſt, that the <hi>VVicked</hi> may doe as well as the <hi>Saints.</hi> Or take the <hi>ſight</hi> of God in the <hi>creatures,</hi> in his providence, or the like; <hi>carnal</hi> men ſo ſee the things of God as the Saints doe, though not altogether ſo well; yet that is no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar thing. But this ſight of God that I ſpeake of, it is only in the <hi>face</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as it is in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. 6. <hi>In whom the God of this world, hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, leaſt the light of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Goſpell of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them. For God who commanded light to ſhine out of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Chriſt the face of God.</note> 
                        <hi>darkneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give us the light of the knowledge of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>face</hi> of God: and as we ſee nothing of a mans body, but by his Face, ſo we ſee nothing of God but in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Therefore when <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>ſhew us the Father &amp; it is ſufficient;</hi> ſaith Chriſt <hi>he that hath ſeen me, hath ſeene the Father:</hi> that is, all in this glorious priviledge of <hi>ſeeing</hi> God, muſt be through the man <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore that is the reaſon that the Saints heretofore, alwayes when they were at a loſſe, and could not ſee God, they ſtill called
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53448:17"/> for his <hi>face,</hi> O <hi>ſhew me thy face,</hi> that is, Lord ſhew thy ſelf to me in thy face, which is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore if any man will ſee God, he need not goe up to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> or deſcend downe into the <hi>Deep,</hi> but he muſt look for it in the <hi>face</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, all this <hi>ſight</hi> of <hi>God</hi> whatſoever it is, it is <note place="margin">4. It is by the word.</note> by the <hi>word</hi> and by the <hi>ſpirit:</hi> For as one godly man ſaith, the <hi>face</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus is as the <hi>looking-glaſſe</hi> wherein we ſee God; and the word of God is the <hi>look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſſe</hi> wherein we ſee <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Therefore in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. God hath ſent us, <hi>to make known the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And then ſaith he, <hi>we have this treaſure in earthen veſſels that the excellency of power might be of God, and not of us.</hi> He had ſaid before that by the preaching of the Goſpel, he had made known the glory of God, in the <hi>face</hi> of Chriſt. Now in this poore deſpicable thing; a man that hath a world of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and many weakneſſes in him; yet in theſe poore earthen <hi>ſhels,</hi> (as the word is in the originall) God hath put this <hi>treaſure.</hi> As we find in naturall things, <hi>Pearles</hi> are in the <hi>ſhels</hi> of little fiſhes, and the <hi>ſhell</hi> is worth nothing: So, though we be little worth, God hath made the preaching of the Goſpell by us, the way to beſtow theſe glorious priviledges. He will make known himſelf in Chriſt, the ſame that ſhall be for ever hereafter, which only the Saints enjoy; and this is by the <hi>word,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it is by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as it is in 2 <hi>Cor. 3. VVhere</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">And by the Spirit.</note> 
                        <hi>the ſpirit is, there is liberty;</hi> where it is not, there is a <hi>vaile</hi> over the heart, and minde that none can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away, but the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God. <hi>Where the ſpirit is, there is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberty.</hi> What is that? When a man hath the Spirit he is freed from that <hi>Vaile;</hi> his <hi>eyes</hi> are <hi>opened;</hi> as he ſaith
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53448:17"/> after, <hi>we that are S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi>.</hi> we have no <hi>vaile,</hi> but <hi>we behold with pen face, the glory of God.</hi> Through the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> we ſee <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and through <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the <hi>Father;</hi> the glory of the Lord: but how? <hi>By the ſpirit of the Lord;</hi> that is, the Spirit of the Lord <hi>uncovers</hi> the face, and <hi>annoints</hi> the eyes. Therefore the Spirit is called <hi>Oyntment;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he annoints the eyes; and he is called <hi>Eye-ſalve, Revel.</hi> 3. he helps us to ſee. So thus you have a little, for it is an unſpeakable thing, and therefore we can only ſpeak a little, aloofe, afarr off, that you may know that there is ſuch a thing; but it is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that muſt beſtow it on you and me.</p>
                     <p>I will add one more particular, becauſe I find it in the Scripture, concerning this <hi>ſeeing</hi> of God. I finde it is ſpoken of 3 wayes, or (as it were) in 3 pathes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt the <hi>Father</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt when <note place="margin">The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhews us Chriſt.</note> we were dead in ſins, and when we ſaw nothing at all, the Father <hi>ſhews us</hi> Chriſt. Before we have any thing to doe with Chriſt <hi>actively,</hi> the Father hath many things to doe on us <hi>paſsively,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith <hi>Joh. 17. Father, all that were thine, thou gaveſt them to me.</hi> Before Chriſt comes the Father is making the <hi>match,</hi> and commending his Sonne to us, when we are meerly <hi>paſsive</hi> in it. For that is a generall rule, a man never <hi>acts,</hi> but by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> therefore let men talke what they will, God may doe what he will paſſively on me, but I am, not to acts at all till Jeſus Chriſt come, but I ſay, <hi>paſsively,</hi> the Father was woing us to his Son, and <hi>no man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>comes to me except the Father draw him; and thoſe that have learned, and are taught of the Father come to me. Joh.</hi> 6. 45. That (I ſay) is one ſight that a poore ſinner hath, a <hi>ſight</hi> of the <hi>Excellency</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. Now it may be if thou look back, and conſider how God did deale with thee at the firſt,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53448:18"/> thou canſt remember when many times Jeſus Chriſt was preſented to thee in his <hi>excellencie,</hi> ſometimes more, ſometimes leſſe, and thou ſaweſt him an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſon, and wouldeſt have given a world for him; and didſt account it a <hi>heaven,</hi> and happineſſe to enjoy him. Now whence was this, but that the Father was willing to make the match between his Son, and thee, and ſhewed this excellency of him?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I finde, on the other ſide, in Scripture, <note place="margin">Chriſt ſhews us the Father</note> that the <hi>Son Chriſt</hi> gives us to <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>Father:</hi> for the Father is not ſeene all this while; thou ſeeſt not who ſhews thee that <hi>Excellency:</hi> thou ſeeſt Chriſt before, and wouldeſt give a world for him; but thou knoweſt not who opened the Window; it is the <hi>Father;</hi> and then Chriſt only ſhews the Father; that is, after thou art married to Chriſt, and Chriſt will ſhew thee thy <hi>Friends.</hi> When Chriſt hath married the Soule, he will ſhew it what riches is in him; what grace, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, and goodneſſe: and ſaith Chriſt, I have a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I am willing that you ſhould be acquainted with him, and know him: ſo Chriſt leads us to the <hi>Father;</hi> that is that Chriſt ſpeaks <hi>Joh. 14. Ye know me, and ye know the Father.</hi> And ſaith he, <hi>haſt thou ſeene me, and not known the Father? he that hath ſeene me hath ſeene the Father:</hi> for wee <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is all the knowledge we have of the Father. for the Father is another perſon, juſt like Chriſt; he is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, no eye ever ſaw him but through Chriſt; that is, I ſee, what <hi>pitty,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe</hi> is in Chriſt, and ſuch is in the Father. There are no two things in all the creation of God, that are ſo like one another, as the Father is to Jeſus Chriſt: ſo that as though I know one Egg, I may know another; &amp; yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53448:18"/> two Eggs are not comparable, or to be mentioned for likeneſſe, as the Father is to Chriſt. So that if a man have perfect underſtanding of Chriſt, he will have alſo of the Father.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, both theſe, though the one be <hi>paſsive,</hi> and <note place="margin">Both done by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> the other <hi>active;</hi> that now I muſt looke with mine <hi>owne</hi> eyes that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath put in my head to ſee the Father: though the Father ſhewed Chriſt to me when I was blind, and dead; I ſay both are done by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, who is called ſometimes the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>God, and ſometimes the ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>the ſpirit ſhall take of my things, and ſhew them to you.</hi> So the Spirit from the one, and the other makes manifeſtations. So you have ſeene a little towards the opening of this glorious priviledge that the Saints have, of ſeeing God in this world. <note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how the Saints ſee God.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are 4 or 5. things more which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of our ſeeing of <hi>God,</hi> and which the Saints finde by experience. I ſhall but briefly touch them.</p>
                     <p>I have told you that a Saint ſees God but in <hi>part,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 They ſee but a part.</note> and yet a Saint ſees but a <hi>part</hi> of God (as it were) at any time. He ſees not <hi>God fully</hi> in any thing, and yet he ſees but a part (as it were) of <hi>God</hi> almoſt at any time; that is, the Lord doth not diſcover al his glory to any Saint at once: but ſomtimes the Lord reveales to his child, and lets him ſee his glorious <hi>power,</hi> in ſuch a way as no carnall man ever ſhall. Another while he, lets him ſee the glory of his Juſtice, and that, it may be raviſheth him for a time. Another while God ſheds his love into his heart, and ſets that before him, <hi>God</hi> might ſhew himſelfe at <hi>once,</hi> he might ſhew himſelfe <hi>fully</hi> if he pleaſed: but this is his manner, and dealing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53448:19"/> as we ſee in the Scriptures, and as the Saints finde generally in Experience. That is one thing.</p>
                     <p>Then ſecondly, in this ſight of God, though the <note place="margin">2. What they ſee is ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> Lord ſhew but part of himſelfe at once, ſometimes it may be a greater part then at an other time; yet that <hi>part,</hi> be it what it will, and be it <hi>little</hi> or <hi>much,</hi> yet it is all amiable in the <hi>eye</hi> of a Saint, and <hi>operative</hi> in his ſoule; my meaning is this, you are not to conceive as though it were the glorious priviledge of a Saint, to ſee one ſide of God as it were, and not another: but that that is moſt terrible in God to wicked men, that is alſo I ſay <hi>amiable,</hi> and <hi>lovely</hi> in the eye of a <hi>Saint.</hi> As the <hi>power</hi> of God, the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of God, the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God. Even theſe things that the wicked <hi>abhorre</hi> and <hi>hate,</hi> the Lord uſeth to reveale them to his Saints, in Excellent Glory. That is an other thing. <note place="margin">3. God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf variouſly.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then thirdly, God doth ſhew himſelfe to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by various manifeſtations. My meaning is this, God doth not alway ſhew himſelfe in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and faſhion to his child; God (as it were) comes in a <hi>new</hi> dreſſe, every day to the Soule of his Child, all the dayes of his life in <hi>this world,</hi> and for ought he knowes, for ever in the world to <hi>come.</hi> As it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable to ſay how God appeares to the ſoule of a Saint: ſo the manifeſtations are innumerable, the ſtrange ways that God comes to the ſoule: he ſhews himſelf to <hi>day</hi> this way, to <hi>morrow</hi> after another, and the <hi>third</hi> day after another. The Lord manifeſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf variouſly. That is another thing</p>
                     <p>Then fourthly it is by <hi>various means</hi> alſo that God <note place="margin">4 By various meanes.</note> comes in by. You muſt underſtand he comes alwayes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53448:19"/> through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> but then for other lower meanes, he chooſeth what meanes he pleaſeth; he comes in, ſomtimes by <hi>afflictions,</hi> and <hi>corrections;</hi> ſomtimes by common <hi>providence,</hi> ſometimes in the <hi>word preached,</hi> ſometimes in <hi>meditation,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in <hi>prayer;</hi> ſome times one way, ſometimes another. The Lord can take any way, any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, any providence, any thing to convey him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by, to the Soule of his Child, in a ſaving way. <note place="margin">5 It is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then laſtly, this ſight of God which is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Saints, it is not <hi>conſtant,</hi> (for ought I know) to any Saint, no, not under the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, much leſſe, under the <hi>Old:</hi> but the Saints have their deſertions in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God <hi>hides</hi> his <hi>face,</hi> though not as oft as he did in the old. Now let me deſire you to lay up theſe things: becauſe they will be neceſſary when we come to ſpeak of the other doctrine. So much concerning the manner, how God reveales him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his children.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now come to the Uſes of this, and then way will be made for the other point, to ſhew how this <hi>ſight</hi> of God doth truly, &amp; kindly, and ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>humble</hi> us.</p>
                     <p>For the Uſe of this. Firſt this ſhews the <hi>happy</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1. The happy eſtate of a Saint in this world.</note> of a <hi>Saint</hi> in <hi>this world,</hi> that he hath (as it were) a <hi>heaven</hi> upon <hi>earth,</hi> becauſe he ſees God. If thou wouldeſt conſider ſeriouſly, that there is ſuch a glorious priviledge as this; thou wouldeſt ſay, <hi>bleſſed</hi> is the man that hath it, and <hi>curſed</hi> and <hi>unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py</hi> is the man that hath it not; it is our Saviours word in the beginning of his Sermon <hi>Math.</hi> 5.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53448:20"/> 
                        <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart; for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> Now purity of heart is not the bleſſing properly, but the <hi>ſeeing</hi> of God. He that is <hi>pure</hi> in heart is a bleſſed man ſaith Chriſt, <hi>for he ſhall ſee God.</hi> So that if thou wilt believe Chriſt Jeſus, If thou be a Saint, and ſee God, and canſt ſay, the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his <hi>glory</hi> to my ſoule in Jeſus Chriſt; then oppoſe that to any <hi>miſerie</hi> that can be in this world. Put any miſerie that makes a man unhappy in this world, in the one ſcale, and that priviledge of ſeeing God in Chriſt in the other ſcale; and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou wilt ſee that thou art a bleſſed, and happy man. As, ſuppoſe thou art a <hi>poore</hi> man, a <hi>plundred</hi> man, <hi>a perſecuted</hi> man, or a <hi>ſick</hi> man or woman; be it what it will, if thou canſt ſee God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, if thou wilt believe Chriſt who is the truth thou art a bleſſed man, a bleſſed woman. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man were <hi>ſick,</hi> and ſhould never ſee <hi>health;</hi> ſuppoſe he were <hi>weake,</hi> and ſhould never ſee <hi>ſtrength,</hi> ſuppoſe he were <hi>poore,</hi> and ſhould never ſee <hi>wealth;</hi> ſuppoſe he were <hi>baniſhed,</hi> and ſhould never ſee his <hi>Countrey,</hi> or his <hi>Friends.</hi> Nay, ſuppoſe a man were ſtarke <hi>blind,</hi> and ſhould never ſee the naturall <hi>Sun;</hi> yet if he have a <hi>pure</hi> heart, he ſhall ſee God, and if thou wilt believe Chriſt Jeſus, thou art a <hi>bleſſed</hi> man or woman. All the <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> in this world put together; all that mankind ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed from the creation, is not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, with one glance of that ſight that a Saint hath thouſands of in his life, of the glory of God in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>We are wont to ſay that there is this difference <note place="margin">The beatifical viſion in this life.</note> and only this difference, betweene <hi>heaven,</hi> and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53448:20"/> 
                        <hi>earth,</hi> that <hi>glory</hi> differs from <hi>grace,</hi> but only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; that glory, and grace are the ſame, and that glory is the <hi>perfection</hi> of grace. That is very true, I deny it not: for <hi>we ſhall be clothed upon with glorie.</hi> But ſome conceive that the <hi>beatificall</hi> viſion, that bleſſed ſight is not in this world, we ſhall not have it till we come to Heaven, It is true, we ſhall not fully, and perfectly: but it is not true any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then as the <hi>part</hi> differs from the whole: For here, even in this world, a Saint in ſome meaſure hath it, he ſees <hi>God</hi> as <hi>truly,</hi> and <hi>rightly</hi> as ever he ſhall hereafter in Heaven; therefore you may ſee what it is to be a Saint. If God ſhould take a poor <hi>Drunkard,</hi> or <hi>Swearer,</hi> and but ſhew his Soule, (as it were) through his fingers, or through a gold ring, one glance of this ſight, he would never be a <hi>Drunkard</hi> or <hi>Swearer,</hi> he would never be a <hi>Railer,</hi> and live as a <hi>Sott</hi> againe, all the dayes of his life, No, it is a glorious condition that a Saint is in.</p>
                     <p>Therefore meet God, and labour to know his glory in Chriſt. And for ſhame be not diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for every trifle in the world. When you heare that <hi>wicked</hi> men proſper, that they have <hi>wealth,</hi> and they ſee their children before their eyes, and their <hi>Bull gendereth,</hi> and their <hi>Cow calveth,</hi> as it is in <hi>Job,</hi> envy not their quality, one glance of this bleſſed ſight is worth more then all that ever they had, or <hi>ſhall</hi> have; therefore pitty them. Nay, if thou wert in <hi>priſon</hi> to <hi>night,</hi> and ſhouldeſt dye to <hi>morrow</hi> the moſt cruell <hi>death</hi> that ever was, yet if the <hi>face</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ſhine on thee, thou art a bleſſed man, it is a glorious condition; thou mayeſt ſay with <hi>David, My lot is fallen in a good ground, I</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:53448:21"/> 
                        <hi>have a goodly heritage.</hi> The Lord hath denyed me worldly things, <hi>wit,</hi> and <hi>wealth,</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>credit,</hi> but God hath been pleaſed to beſtow this, <hi>the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt.</hi> Therefore never look dejected or ſad more; <hi>envie</hi> others no more; but <hi>pitty</hi> them, and <hi>weep</hi> for them, thou haſt infinitly a greater <hi>treaſure,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>we have this treaſure in earthen Veſſels.</hi> What is that <hi>treaſure?</hi> Nothing in the world, but the manifeſtation of God in Chriſt; therefore bring thy ſoule to the reſolution of that Diſciple, <hi>Lord ſhew us the Father, and we are ſatisfied:</hi> So ſay to God, Lord <hi>ſhew</hi> me thy glory in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and I have enough, though I have not wealth, nor glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor money, nor any thing, let the world have all, I have a good bargaine I will bleſſe, and praiſe thee world without end.</p>
                     <p>And if this be the <hi>priviledge,</hi> and <hi>bleſſednes</hi> of a S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <note place="margin">The miſerie of wicked men.</note> to ſee God. Then ſee alſo what a miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thou art in, that art a poore carnall man, that though it may be thou ſeeſt thy wealth increaſe, and thy Children playing in the ſtreets, yet thou never ſaweſt God, thou never hadſt one glimpſe of this glorious priviledge that I now ſpeak of. Therefore as it is the chiefe thing in Heaven to ſee God; ſo doubtleſſe it muſt be the chief thing in Hell to be throwne away from Gods preſence, not to ſee God. Therefore in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. it is ſaid that wicked people ſhall be puniſhed <hi>from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi> that is the maine thing in Hell to be thrown from the <hi>preſence</hi> of God, never to ſee his face more, ſo <hi>a carnall</hi> man hath a <hi>Hell</hi> upon <hi>Earth;</hi> thou that art not a <hi>new creature</hi> thou art in <hi>Hel</hi> as it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53448:21"/> were already: becauſe the main thing to be had in this world, and in the world to come, thou doſt wholly want. That is the firſt thing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if this be ſo, that there is ſuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. The fight of God ſhould humble Saints.</note> 
                        <hi>prerogative</hi> of the Saints to <hi>ſee</hi> God; then this above al things in the world ſhould moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy ſoule for thy <hi>ſins</hi> (as hereafter I ſhall ſhew more fully) this ſhould move thee to <hi>mourne</hi> for thy <hi>ſins.</hi> Why ſo? You all know it is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at leaſt, not meerly the <hi>knowing</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> and of the <hi>wrath,</hi> and <hi>curſe</hi> that will melt the heart: that, of it ſelf <hi>hardens</hi> the heart; but you know by your owne experience, that when you come to the veine, where thoſe ſweet teares of repentance lye, it is the <hi>ſeeing</hi> of the <hi>kindneſſe</hi> of God, of the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of God, of the <hi>mercy</hi> of God; and then to think that I ſhould be ſuch a wretch, as to abuſe his <hi>goodnes;</hi> to <hi>grieve,</hi> and provoke him that is my <hi>Father,</hi> and to <hi>crucifie</hi> him again, and again, that is my <hi>Saviour.

Where God by the Prophet tels <hi>David</hi> of his ſin; and as a motive to humble him, ſaith he, <hi>I made thee King of Iſrael, and Judah;</hi> and if that were too little, <hi>I gave thee wealth, I gave thee thy Maſters houſe, and thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters wives into thy boſome.</hi> I tooke thee when thou wert a little lad <hi>following the ſheep, and I made thee King of Iſrael, and if this had been too little, I would have given thee more;</hi> but that thou ſhouldeſt play the villaine, that thou ſhouldeſt goe and take an
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53448:22"/> honeſt mans wife, he that had but one ſheep, and play the Beaſt, and doe <hi>folly in Iſrael;</hi> this was that that wounded the heart of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and thereupon he went and penned 7. penitentiall Pſalmes, and goes, and cries, <hi>have mercy upon me O God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the multitude of thy mercies.</hi> Theſe <hi>mercies</hi> that are <hi>ordinary,</hi> when we walke unworthily they grate the heart.</p>
                     <p>But if a man can come, and ſay, God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed <note place="margin">Spirituall mercies abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed cauſe greateſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</note> that on me, that he hath not upon any reprobate; the <hi>knowing,</hi> or the enjoyment of the knowledge of his glory in the <hi>face</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, O, as it is a mercy unutterable, and invaluable, that the ſoule is not able to expreſſe it when it hath it: (Indeed the ſoule can ſay, it never found the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but it left the Soule unſatisfied, or worſe then it was: but ſaith the ſoule, if Gods face ſhine but a quarter of an houre, if it be but in a <hi>buſh,</hi> or in a <hi>Garret,</hi> I am ſatisfied, I deſire no more, if this might but continue.

                        <hi>his Father did</hi> (the more too blame he) <hi>he built high places for Chemoſh, and Molech; Solomon</hi> built Altars and offered ſacrifice to Idols; and likewiſe he did it for all his ſtrange <hi>wives; And the Lord was angrie with Solomon, becauſe his heart was turned from the Lord God of Iſrael, which had appeared to him twice. which had appeared twice to him;</hi> there is the motive to aggravate it. The Lord was angry, not ſo much becauſe he had ſo many ſins, and had built ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Altars, but this was the aggravation, becauſe the <hi>Lord had appeared twice</hi> to <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſo as he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done to any other from the beginning of the world; the Lord appeared <hi>ſavingly,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritually</hi> to him, and yet he ſinned againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Now if God appeared to <hi>Solomon</hi> but <hi>twice,</hi> and his ſin is aggravated by that; how great is my ſin in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> where things are more clearly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, then ever they were in thoſe times, and God hath appeared <hi>two hundred</hi> times, <hi>two thouſand</hi> times to my ſoule: I have ſeene him one while in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> I have ſeen him among the <hi>Saints,</hi> I have ſeene him in ſuch a <hi>country,</hi> in ſuch a <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in ſuch a <hi>place,</hi> in ſuch a <hi>medow,</hi> in ſuch a <hi>wood,</hi> when I read his word, and <hi>called</hi> upon his name, and yet that I ſhould be ſuch a <hi>Villaine,</hi> that I ſhould be thus <hi>proud,</hi> and thus <hi>froward,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> the world ſo much, and ſo eaſily provoke God, and lie ſo <hi>ſottiſhly</hi> in it when I have done; it is one of the greateſt motives in the World, to move a ſpirituall heart to be abaſed, and humbled for ſins paſt.</p>
                     <p>And likewiſe to <hi>preſerve</hi> it from ſin for the time <note place="margin">Sight of God a preſervation from ſinne.</note> to come, <hi>I have ſet God</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>at my right</hi>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53448:23"/> 
                        <hi>hand that I might not ſin againſt him;</hi> that is, I will keep God in my eye.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eye</hi> of God is a meanes to keep a man from ſin: for who will ſin in the eye of God? therefore ſaith God to <hi>Abraham, walk before me, and be perfect.</hi> The Servant may doe ill behind his Maſters back, but walk before me, and then thou wilt be upright, therefore when men ſin they are ſaid to leave God: but ſaith David <hi>I have ſet God at my right hand, that I might not ſinne against him,</hi> I will alway ſee God, as I ſee a man that walks at my right hand.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if there be ſuch a <hi>ſight</hi> of God to be <note place="margin">

Truly, (beloved) if you doe not look on the Goſpell with a ſpirituall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; to a carnall eye it is the <hi>pooreſt,</hi> and <hi>drieſt,</hi> and moſt <hi>beggarly</hi> thing in the world; for, there are none that have more weakneſſes, then the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of it. It is a thing that ſhould fill men with admiration to conſider what it is to have <hi>poore</hi> creatures to doe the work of God that have a <hi>world</hi> of weakneſſes more then other men, who are more exact in their wayes as <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> &amp;c. To a carnall eye the preaching of the Goſpell is a dead, drouſie thing; a man ſhall heare many things that he heard before, and be taught till he ſleep, and be tyred out, unleſſe he look on it with a ſpiritual eye. As the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Merchant when he ſees ſuch a <hi>ſhell</hi> he conſiders what is in it; there is a glorious <hi>Pearle</hi> in it, and for that he goes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53448:23"/> many a Mile. So doe you conſider that the preaching of the Goſpell by poore and weake meanes, it is that ſhell, that <hi>Cabinet,</hi> wherein theſe glorious <hi>treaſures</hi> are found; therefore eſteeme it, and priſe it highly, look on it with reverence, look for the <hi>Pearle</hi> in it; priſe it, and praiſe God for it.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſome of you, that are ſleepy <note place="margin">Why men ſee not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the Goſpel.</note> creatures, may ſay, I cannot tell that there is any ſuch thing in it; &amp; others are ſo ſottiſh to this day, that they no more know nor underſtand, what we have bin doing in the preaching of the word theſe 12. moneths, then a Poſt.</p>
                     <p>It is not becauſe the treaſure is not here, but you ſhal ſee the reaſon, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. the reaſon why you ſee it not; is becauſe, <hi>The God of this world hath blinded your eyes, that the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, ſhould not ſhine upon your Soules.</hi> God <hi>ſhines</hi> upon <hi>one</hi> mans Soule, and not upon another, another ſees nothing but a poor Preacher, full of weakneſſes, &amp; ſo he gos away, &amp; remembers little or nothing, or it may be ſleeps all the while. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved for the Lord Jeſus ſake trifle not: It makes me tremble to conſider ſeriouſly how thoſe <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi> that are infinite, and innumerable that were before the beginning of the world, are to be <hi>opened,</hi> when we preach the word; yonder <hi>man,</hi> and yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>woman,</hi> we know not whether of them belong to God, or the Devill; but when we preach the decree is opened; there is a poor man, or a poore woman that belongs to life, it makes him a <hi>new creature;</hi> another is as very a <hi>Sot</hi> at the yeares end, as at the <hi>beginning;</hi> who would not <hi>tremble,</hi> when
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53448:24"/> God threatens to <hi>ſeale</hi> up your condition by it! O! it is a glorious thing, the Goſpell. Look to it you <hi>ſottiſh</hi> people, that are like the <hi>Foole</hi> in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi> that tell him a <hi>tale,</hi> and when you have done he will aske, <hi>what is the matter;</hi> or as, a man aſleep, that knows nothing what he hath been doing. For the Lords ſake conſider what we are doing, and what the Goſpell is; and what it is to have one day of the Son of man; it is a very ſtrange word in <hi>Luk. 17. 32. conſider</hi> of it thou poore <hi>ſottiſh</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: When Chriſt was demanded of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> when the Kingdome of God ſhould come, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, <hi>The Kingdom of God commeth not with obſervation. Neither ſhall they ſay, lo here, or lo there, for behold the Kingdome of God is within you,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you; <hi>And he ſaid unto his Diſciples, the dayes will come when ye ſhall deſire to ſee one of the dayes of the Sonne of man, and ye ſhall not ſee it.</hi> And yet he ſaith after, they ſhall ſee the day of the <hi>Son of man.</hi> We are to conſider, <hi>the ſonne of Man,</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath two ſorts of dayes: He hath one <note place="margin">2 Sorts of dayes of the Sons of man.</note> day that every wicked man ſhall ſee, when they ſhal be <hi>eating and drinking as in the dayes of Noah; When the Son of man ſhall come to judge according to my Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> preacheth; &amp; according to the Goſpel <note place="margin">The day of judgement.</note> that you have here preached; That is, one day of the <hi>Son of man.</hi> And thou that wilt not receive Chriſt, thou ſhalt have thy belly full of that day, it will be a <hi>terribble</hi> day, a day of <hi>blacknes</hi> and <hi>darknes</hi> when the <hi>earth ſhall reele as a drunkard, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall be gathered together as a ſcrowle,</hi> and the <hi>world</hi> ſhall be on fire, and thou ſhalt be at thy wits end, it will be a terrible day: the Lord deliver thee from that day.</p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53448:24"/>
                     <p>But the Son of Man hath another day, that is, <note place="margin">The day of grace.</note> the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> the day wherein the <hi>Son of man</hi> in the <hi>preaching</hi> of the Goſpell would beſtow grace upon thy Soule. Why doth he call that the day of the <hi>Son of man</hi> more then the other? He delights more in it; he delights not in the death of a ſinner. This is that ſweet day that Jeſus Chriſt delights in, to offer himſelf to thee, and to lay before thee, <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> by his death. Theſe things were not written for them only, but for us alſo. Remember, the day will come when thou ſhalt <hi>deſire to ſee one day of the ſon of Man, but ſhalt not ſee it.</hi> Thou wilt ſay, O that I had one ſuch day, as we have now in this place; when the Preacher told me of ſeeing God, and Chriſt; O that I had but one day, but one <hi>motion</hi> in my heart, by the Spirit that I had then, and yet I ſotted it out and did forget it; O that God would ſmile as he did then, but it ſhall not be. Therefore the Lord help you that you doe not trifle out your ſalvation, as abundance in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in this Citty doe, between <hi>ſottiſhnes</hi> and <hi>formalitie.</hi> Abundance of People heare the word, but here is abundance of <hi>formalitie;</hi> few men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with whom they have to do, when they heare the word of God, and what the buſines is, but in a trifling manner paſſe it by: Therefore conſider what treaſure there is in the <hi>Goſpell;</hi> there are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable treaſures</hi> in the Goſpell; but of all, this is the Jewell of all, <hi>the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I ſhall leave other things for the next opportunity.</p>

<q>
                           <p>The Saints have a peculiar privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge above all others, that they can even in this world ſee God. They can ſee God in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>I did open this, as farre as I could dive into the ſcriptures unto you, and proved it, and made ſome Uſes of it. There is ſomewhat yet remaines of it, which I ſhall indeavour briefly to goe through, and then we ſhall come to the next poynt, which is, that,
<q>
                           <p>A right ſaving ſight of God, of the glory of God in Jeſus Chriſt, is the way to true Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell humiliation.</p>

                     <p>We have made 3. uſes of the former point.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to ſhew the <hi>priviledge</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> that they, and they only can <hi>ſee</hi> God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the <hi>ſight</hi> of God ſhould <hi>humble</hi> the Saints for their ſins.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it ſhould teach us to <hi>priſe</hi> the <hi>preaching</hi> of the word, whereby this glorious priviledge is diſcovered, and wherein this excellent treaſure is contained.</p>
                     <p>There are two things that I ſhall endeavour this day, as the Lord ſhall help me in this great miſterie, to make out to you.</p>
                     <p>The one is, ſeeing there is ſuch a glorious <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> to be had, and bleſſed is the man that hath it, as I told you; <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God. Purity</hi> of heart is the <hi>qualification,</hi> and <hi>ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of God is the <hi>reward,</hi> the higheſt ſtep of it. And ſeeing there is ſuch a Curſe to a man that ſees not God, how ſhall we know whether ever we had this <hi>priviledge?</hi> whether God hath vouchſafed to us this peculiar ſight of him? <hi>I have ſeene the King, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then ſecondly, if I have it not, what courſe I ſhal take to attaine it? I ſhall ſpeak of theſe two things only this day.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the former; I need not give you <note place="margin">This peculiar fight of God knowne.</note> 
                        <hi>ſignes,</hi> or <hi>marks,</hi> to know whether a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> or a <hi>Whoremonger,</hi> or a blind <hi>carnall</hi> creature, that knows nothing of the will of God; whether any of theſe ſee God.</p>
                     <p>But the buſines comes to this: Seeing there is a <hi>Goſpell</hi> enlightning, or illumination; ſeeing there is a kind of <hi>ſight</hi> of God in Chriſt, that an <hi>Hypocrite</hi>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:53448:26"/> hath, and yet it is not the glorious <hi>ſight</hi> that the Saints have; the queſtion wil be, how we ſhall know the one from the other? And then there will be a light whereby a ſinner, a carnall man may know his eſtate; that will flow from the other: For, if wee diſcover the one, it will be eaſie by that light to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the other.</p>
                     <p>For your information in the former (according as I underſtand by conſidering of the Scripture, and ſeeking the Lord, and ſearching mine owne heart) I ſhall reduce all to theſe 3 heads: You may know it 3 wayes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, by your <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by the <hi>impreſsions</hi> that this hath upon you.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by the <hi>Expreſsions</hi> or <hi>Effects</hi> that it workes.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall endeavour to cleare theſe three things to you.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I ſay by your apprehenſions. That is, by <note place="margin">1 By our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of God which are.</note> the manner of your apprehending God in Chriſt. Becauſe (that I may ſpeake punctually in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Scriptures) though another man may be ſaid to <hi>ſee</hi> God, and to <hi>know</hi> God, yet he <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends</hi> not God, or Chriſt, or any thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to either in that way and manner that an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Saint doth.</p>
                     <p>Now there are theſe 3 things in the <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of a Saint that ſees God aright.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is this, theſe <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of him, they <note place="margin">1 Cleare appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions.</note> are cleare apprehenſions of him; the <hi>Hypocrites ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,</hi> they are <hi>darke</hi> and <hi>doubtfull,</hi> they are myſty; I ſay the <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of a Saint they are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53448:27"/> 
                        <hi>cleare.</hi> I doe not meane by cleare, that they are full: For, I told you before, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>why doe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What meant by it.</note> 
                        <hi>we yet hope, if we ſeen</hi> that is, if wee did <hi>fully</hi> ſee. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I meane by cleare, that they are alwayes <hi>conſtant,</hi> that we have them without any <hi>doubts,</hi> or <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> or <hi>miſts:</hi> eſpecially in the old Teſtament, the Saints were many times <hi>eclipſed,</hi> and God <hi>hid</hi> his <hi>face,</hi> and they were at a loſſe, they knew not where to ſee him; in the morning he was ſeene, and he was gone at <hi>night;</hi> and ſo for a little moment (as it is ſaid) he would come, and then be gone againe, that is not the meaning. But when I ſay they are cleare, as it is, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. We all with open face, behold the glory of God.</hi> With <hi>open face;</hi> that is, we doe not ſee God, as a man ſees through a handkerchiefe, or through a Sieve, or through a Skarfe, or a Cloud; but with <hi>open face;</hi> we ſee him clearly, our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions are cleare; that is, there is an <hi>aſſurance</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Aſſurance in the Saints ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions.</note> along with your <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> that doth <hi>certifie</hi> your Soules, and aſſure your ſoules, that it is God that you ſee, it is a ſight of God. For as in naturall things, you know, that by the ſame <hi>light</hi> whereby I ſee the Sun, by the ſame light I know that I ſee him: So there is in the very <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of God to the ſoule, it carries a witneſſe in it ſelf, it is ſo cleare, that when I have it, though I never had it before, and I cannot demonſtratively ſpeak a word what it is, yet I know as it is Gods ſight, ſo I know I ſee him. A Saint knows ſo ſurely, and certainly, as that there is not the leaſt doubt to his ſoule of that ſight. As in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. (which is worth obſerving) you ſhall find that there is a great myſtery that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that a Saint ſees, that a carnall, naturall man
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53448:27"/> cannot perceive; there be <hi>the deep things of God;</hi> and one of them he ſaith is Chriſt Jeſus: for the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, the <hi>Princes of the world did not know him,</hi> they did not know, <hi>him and the Father to be one,</hi> as it is <hi>Joh.</hi> 14: Now in that miſticall knowledge in that 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. obſerve two things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you ſhal ſee that there is a miſtery in <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A miſterie in the manner of the Saints knowledge.</note> theſe things: Not in the <hi>knowing</hi> of the things for the matter, I told you they are not miſticall in the matter; for they are nothing but the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>power</hi> of his reſurrection, and the like, that he calls, <hi>the deepe things of God,</hi> that Chriſt dyed for us, &amp;c. But the depth is in the manner of the knowing of them; they that are <hi>Hypocrites</hi> know them for the matter; they know Chriſt from top to toe, they ſee him <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>buried,</hi> and put in the <hi>Grave,</hi> and the like, but they doe not ſpiritually know them.</p>
                     <p>So alſo, the other <hi>myſterie</hi> of that <hi>ſpiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Saints know that they know the things of God.</note> is in the <hi>knowing</hi> that they did <hi>know:</hi> It is one thing to believe, and another thing to know that I doe believe; and it is one thing to know ſpirituall miſteries, and another thing to <hi>know</hi> that I doe know them.</p>
                     <p>Now when the Apoſtle had done with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he comes to the latter, and tels them that they had a light, <hi>whereby they knew the things that were free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given them of God:</hi> As he ſaith, <hi>no man knoweth the things of a man, but the ſpirit of a man that is in him.</hi> So I have the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, that I <hi>know</hi> the things, and I know that I know them. So the <hi>myſterie</hi> of ſpirituall knowledg is to <hi>know</hi> heavenly things in a ſpirituall <hi>manner,</hi> and then to <hi>know</hi> that I <hi>know</hi>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:53448:28"/> them. It is one thing to know ſpirituall things, and it is another to know that I know them. It is one thing for God to give heavenly things, and it is another to know that God hath given them. This is the meaing of it, when I ſay that the people of God have a ſight of God, and it is a cleare ſight; that is, it carries ſuch a kind of <hi>evidence</hi> to the ſoule, that thou <hi>knoweſt aſſuredly,</hi> as thou knoweſt any thing in the world, that thou <hi>ſeeſt</hi> God in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it was a knowne caſe among them in the <hi>old</hi> Teſtament (and much more muſt it be in the <hi>new)</hi> it was ſo certaine, that if God were away but for a moment, they preſently miſſed him, and they cryed, <hi>Thou haſt hid thy face,</hi> and <hi>when wilt thou come againe?</hi> and over night he would be gone, and they were troubled, and they knew him as ſoone as he came, and they miſſed him when ever he went. Now when thou haſt but a <hi>blind confuſed apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of God, and it is but <hi>thinking,</hi> and <hi>hoping,</hi> and thou <hi>miſſeſt</hi> God, and thou knoweſt not what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him, nor thou <hi>lookeſt</hi> not after him, ſuſpect thy apprehenſion of him, that it is not <hi>right:</hi> for if it be a <hi>right</hi> knowledge, it is as <hi>cleare</hi> as the <hi>Sun,</hi> though it be not <hi>fully</hi> cleare, yet it is ſo cleare, that thou knoweſt that thou haſt God; and thou doeſt miſſe him if he be gone but for a time: That is one thing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, theſe <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> as they are <hi>cleare,</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53448:28"/> 17. The Prophet <hi>David,</hi> (who was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with God; ſaith he, <hi>how precious alſo are the thoughts of thee O God! how great is the ſumme of them; if I account them they are more in number then the ſands: when I awake, I am ſtill with thee.</hi> They are many then; and that is a ſhame for us in the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, that they had ſuch <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> and we ſhould have ſo few. <hi>And how precious are they!</hi> ſaith he. As if he had ſaid, I love my <hi>Wife</hi> well, and my <hi>Husband</hi> well, and I love to have things about me; and to have health after ſicknes: But Lord, <hi>how precious are the thoughts of thee O God!</hi> how rich is one thought of God! What a rich man am I, when I have one thought of God: Now theſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are <hi>precious</hi> in theſe 3 reſpects.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, they are <hi>precious,</hi> becauſe every one of thoſe <note place="margin">1 They ſatisfie the Soule.</note> thoughts fully ſatisfy the <hi>ſoule.</hi> Take any thing in this world, as it may be thou haſt an eſtate, or thou haſt ſuch friends, or thou haſt ſuch comforts: Take any thing whatever thou canſt, there is an emptines left ſtill in ſome corner of the ſoule, it is not filled. A man may ſay when he is higheſt in the comforts of the <hi>world,</hi> I am not fully ſatisfied, there is ſome <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet</hi> in my <hi>Spirit;</hi> there is ſomwhat, whatſoever it is, behind the back of that comfort that I look for. But when a man hath <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of God <hi>aright,</hi> they <hi>ſatisfie the ſoule,</hi> and <hi>fill</hi> it with ſuch <hi>contentedneſſe,</hi> that a man can ſay, <hi>I have enough;</hi> and he can ſay with <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſaw the glory of God. <hi>It is good to be here;</hi> though he had neither <hi>meat</hi> nor <hi>drink,</hi> but were upon a <hi>mountaine;</hi> only he ſaw the glory of God; and ſaith he, <hi>It is good to be here.</hi> Therefore we might ſee, in divers places that I could reckon in Scripture, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53448:29"/> 
                        <hi>As for me, I will behold thy face in righteouſneſſe,</hi> (I will behold thee in Chriſt) <hi>and when I awake, I ſhall be ſatisfied with thine Image:</hi> I ſhall be ſatisfied ſaith he. So alſo in <hi>Pſal. 63. 3, 4, 5. I ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſſe,</hi> and that is a choice thing in this world, though it come farre ſhort of this. And ſo <hi>Paul, Phil. 3. I account all Dung for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and excellent knowledge of Chriſt:</hi> As if he had ſaid, I would be ſatisfied with this, though I had not a penny in the world. Now it is not ſo with an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite</hi> (therefore examin your heart, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crits ſatisfie not.</note> it) an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> when he is <hi>enlightned,</hi> he may have ſome ſweetnes, and there is ſome pleaſure; as when his gifts are <hi>enlarged;</hi> or when <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things eſpecially when <hi>new</hi> notions come in his minde for ever the knowledge of <hi>new</hi> things is <hi>pleaſant,</hi> both <hi>naturall,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall:</hi> Yet notwithſtanding an Hypocrite is not ſatisfied, with the ſight of God in Chriſt, he cannot ſay I deſire no more; but he ſaith, I will be Rich for all this, I will cozen, and cheat for all this: Therefore I have alway obſerved, that the beſt of wicked men, thoſe that we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect, that they are not right, and they may have a great deale of joy, and ſuch like; yet they are as greedy and <hi>griping</hi> after the world, and as <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>vain</hi> as others, and that is an argument that they are not ſatisfied. Another poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, though he make not ſuch a <hi>blaze</hi> with <hi>gifts,</hi> and <hi>expreſsions,</hi> yet he <hi>ſees</hi> God, now and then, and he can <hi>tread</hi> and <hi>trample</hi> upon the <hi>world,</hi> he can <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>friends,</hi> and <hi>honours,</hi> and <hi>riches,</hi> and can look on them as <hi>crucified</hi> things, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, and can ſay, I remember, in ſuch a Countrey, in ſuch a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53448:29"/> Chamber, in ſuch a place, where God ſhew'd himſelf to me, and I was ſatisfied; I ſaw every thing vaniſh before me, and I deſired nothing but that, and I could deſire to <hi>change,</hi> my <hi>wealth,</hi> and all for that, ſo that might be continued, and enlarged: That is one thing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are <hi>precious,</hi> becauſe he is <hi>not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 There is a deſire of more.</note> This is no contradiction though it ſeeme to be one. My meaning is this, that wherever there is this apprehenſion of God, though it ſatisfie in reſpect of <hi>luſt,</hi> and <hi>ſin,</hi> and the <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>Devill;</hi> yet it creates, and begets in the ſoule a greater <hi>thirſt</hi> for <hi>more</hi> of that apprehenſion. Therefore we ſee clearely, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. where <hi>Paul</hi> runs a race (as it were) after the knowledge of God in Chriſt: See what the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>I account all as Dung, and Droſſe, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſſe of all things, and account them Dung;</hi> I have loſt all, and I am not ſorry for it: And why is all this? <hi>That I may know him, and the power of his reſurrection.</hi> Now <hi>Paul</hi> was a Preacher, and did he not <hi>know</hi> Chriſt? there had been a <hi>blind</hi> Preacher. He was an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and <hi>Doctor</hi> of the Gentiles; and did he not know the <hi>reſurrection?</hi> Yes, but the meaning is this, <hi>He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate that which was behind,</hi> as we ſee after; that is, all that <hi>apprehenſion</hi> he had of God in Chriſt, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it, in regard of the affection to deſire <hi>more,</hi> he did not eye what he had: Therefore ſaith he, I ſay, <hi>not as though I apprehended; but I deſire to apprehend him, by whom I am comprehended,</hi> to ſee the <hi>glory</hi> of God, that <hi>comprehends</hi> me in Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>I ſpeake not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as though I had attained;</hi> as if he had ſaid,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53448:30"/> I know nothing in compariſon of the <hi>inſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> I have to know more.</p>
                     <p>And that is the reaſon why <hi>Hypocrites</hi> are very <hi>loath</hi> to <hi>dye,</hi> when <hi>danger</hi> and <hi>death</hi> approacheth; <note place="margin">Hypocrites loath to dye, Why?</note> whereas a right <hi>Saint</hi> is wondrous <hi>deſirous</hi> to <hi>dye;</hi> Why ſo? Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>That I may be with Chriſt.</hi> Phil. 1. Whereto compare that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. that I may ſee God, and have the <hi>ſame glory</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Therefore thou mayeſt <hi>trie</hi> thy ſelfe by this: if thou haſt ſomething that is like the <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of God (I ſpeak not to dull creatures that are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the world, all the yeare long) but if God work on thee in his word, and there is ſome <hi>light</hi> come in, and ſome <hi>ſweetneſſe,</hi> yet if thou be <hi>glutted</hi> with this, and when thou commeſt home thou throweſt God away, and thou <hi>lookeſt</hi> after thy <hi>luſt,</hi> and after thy <hi>ſin,</hi> thou never yet hadſt a right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God: For, if thou ſee God aright, thou wilt looke for <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>more,</hi> and for ought I know, thou wilt have <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>more,</hi> world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and laſtly; theſe <hi>apprehenſions</hi> are <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3 They are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent joy.</note> becauſe there is a <hi>tranſcendent ſuper-excellent,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joy and delight, in the enjoyment of them, <hi>Abraham ſaw my day, and rejoyced,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: He did not ſee his day as an animate creature; but he <hi>ſaw</hi> the <hi>miſterie</hi> of God that ſhould be fulfilled in thoſe dayes, that is the meaning; ſo <hi>Araham ſaw my day, and rejoyced.</hi> So there is a very pregnant word concerning this, in <hi>Iſa. 35. The Deſart ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and the VVildernes ſhall be glad.</hi> By the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Solitary place,</hi> is meant the <hi>barren</hi> Soule, the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53448:30"/> Wildernes of thy heart, where God will dwell. <hi>The VVildernes ſhall be glad, and the Deſart ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. O!</hi> that God would make it ſo to us. <hi>It ſhall bloſsome abundantly, and rejoyce with ſinging, The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lebanon ſhal be given unto it,</hi> &amp;c. Why is all this? <hi>They ſhall ſee the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.</hi> This makes, the <hi>ſad</hi> Soule <hi>rejoyce,</hi> and makes the <hi>barren</hi> heart, <hi>bloſſome</hi> as a <hi>Roſe,</hi> when they <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of the Lord, and the <hi>Excellency of our God.</hi> Nay, it is ſuch a joy, as he ſaith after, that, <hi>The Eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and the Eares of the deafe ſhall be unſtopped; then the lame Man ſhall leap, and the Tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing.</hi> It is ſuch <hi>joy</hi> as will make a <hi>dumb man ſing;</hi> it will make a <hi>mellancholy, heavy, mopiſh</hi> creature, that naturally never <hi>ſmiled;</hi> God manifeſted in Chriſt, will make him <hi>ſing,</hi> and the <hi>lame</hi> man to <hi>leap</hi> for joy; it is a <hi>tranſcendent,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high <hi>joy,</hi> and this <hi>joy,</hi> it will be the ſame joy <note place="margin">Joy of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, What?</note> in Heaven, that we had on Earth. It is not <hi>Eating,</hi> and <hi>Drinking,</hi> and <hi>Marrying,</hi> and <hi>Buying,</hi> and <hi>Selling,</hi> that will be the <hi>joy</hi> in Heaven, but the great <hi>joy</hi> will be, the beholding the Glory of God in Chriſt; that will be the <hi>great</hi> Joy.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, thou mayſt know by this; it may be thou haſt a little joy: Thou rejoyceſt in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Word;</hi> but is there not ſome other Joy that thou <hi>preferreſt?</hi> Art thou not more glad when thou haſt a good <hi>bargaine;</hi> or when thy <hi>affaires</hi>

He may <hi>forget</hi> that he hath done naturall things: We may forget what wee did twenty or thirty yeares agone; we may forget where we were, and may forget our <hi>Friends,</hi> &amp;c. But when God reveales himſelfe firſt to the <hi>Soule:</hi> If a man could live in this World a <hi>thouſand</hi> yeares, the apprehenſion that he had of God at the firſt, it would be as <hi>freſh</hi> as ever it was; becauſe it is an <hi>eternall</hi> thing, it is a thing that we ſhall have more, and more in Heaven, it is not crruptible; <note place="margin">Triall of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. by their laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> and therefore it goes not out.</p>
                     <p>Now it may be thou haſt been a Profeſſor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53448:31"/> and God hath ſtamped a great deale of <hi>joy</hi> on thee, and now it is gone, and thou art poor wretch, a poore drie creature; as drie as a <hi>Chipp,</hi> and a man can ſcarce ſee any thing in thee, to diſtinguiſh thee from a <hi>carnall</hi> man; trie thy ſelf by this: Theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions if they be <hi>right,</hi> they are <hi>perpetuall,</hi> and conſtant in a ſenſe; Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Joh. 14. 21.

Seeing of God,</hi> &amp; <hi>dwelling</hi> in God are <hi>Sinonomies,</hi> one, and the ſame thing; God dwelling in us, or we in God, or ſeeing of God, they are the ſame: Becauſe, whereſoever God is <hi>ſeen rightly,</hi> and <hi>truly,</hi> it brings God by his Spirit to dwell in the Soule. That is one thing you may know it by, by your <hi>apprehenſions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, you may know it by the <hi>impreſsions</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, as I told you before, when a Saint ſeeth <note place="margin">1 Suitable to that they ſee in God.</note> God, you are to underſtand, that he ſeeth al in God with redundance; he ſees his <hi>love,</hi> his <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> his <hi>power,</hi> his <hi>faithfulneſſe,</hi> his <hi>mercy,</hi> his <hi>juſtice.</hi> Now the ſame <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of theſe things, have ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon thy heart, that thou mayeſt clearely diſcerne, if thy <hi>ſight</hi> be <hi>right;</hi> that is, if every one of theſe doe worke upon thy heart, a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

And ſo when thou <hi>ſeeſt</hi> his <hi>faithfulneſſe,</hi> it works an <hi>impreſsion</hi> of <hi>truſt;</hi> that thou wilt <hi>truſt him though he kill thee:</hi> and ſo all that is in God will ſinck into thy heart, and worke <hi>ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> to that that is in God.</p>
                     <p>As to give you one inſtance (for as it will doe by one, ſo it will doe by all) In <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 27. It is ſaid, <hi>By faith Moſes forſook Aegypt, not fearing the wrath of the King: For he endured, as ſeeing him who is inviſible. Moſes</hi> had a <hi>ſight</hi> of him who is <hi>inviſible:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he forſook <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and feared not the wrath of the King. What is the meaning of that? The meaning of it, is this; he ſaw the King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to be a <hi>great</hi> King, a <hi>powerfull</hi> King: But becauſe he had ſeene God, who is inviſible; that is, he had <hi>ſeene</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of God, and the <hi>Greatneſſe</hi> of God, and that put ſuch an <hi>impreſsion</hi> on him, that he did not feare <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> And God had promiſed to doe him good, and having ſeene the faithfulneſſe of God, he forſooke <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So it will be with thee, if thou ſee the <hi>Grace</hi> of God in Chriſt, there will be an <hi>impreſsion</hi> of <hi>love</hi> upon thy Soule: If thou ſee the <hi>Greatneſſe</hi> of God, there will be <hi>Reverence</hi> imprinted upon thy heart: or if thou ſee the <hi>Faithfulneſſe</hi> of God, there will be an impreſſion of <hi>Truſt</hi> upon thy heart.

Doeſt thou finde when thou commeſt to reall miſerie, that there is reall comfort to hold thee up; and not only ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and vaine Speculations: As you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, many brave glorious Profeſſors in the time of Peace, that out ſtrip all their Brethren, and their <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Why many Profeſſors ſhrinke in Trouble.</note> are better then others, &amp; they carry it glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and yet you ſhall have ſome poor creatures that can hardly ſpeake to God in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and can hardly <hi>remember</hi> any thing of the <hi>VVord,</hi> and yet when they come to ſuffer, there is a reall thing that holds them up, though it may be it be but a poore little <hi>Boy,</hi> or a <hi>VVench,</hi> when you ſhall ſee thoſe <hi>Brave</hi> glorious <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> that becauſe they have no Reality, they flee away, and turne to the World.</p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>pray</hi> to the Lord that theſe <hi>impreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> may be <hi>reall:</hi> That as the miſeries wee meet withall, are <hi>reall;</hi> ſo the <hi>impreſsions</hi> of his bleſſed Majeſty may be <hi>be reall:</hi> Saith God to the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, <hi>Mal. 1.

                        <note place="margin">2 They are thorow.</note> they fall not upon the heart of a <hi>Saint,</hi> as they doe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53448:33"/> upon an <hi>Hypocrite.</hi> The <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of <hi>God</hi> fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> juſt like a little ſhower of raine, upon the <hi>ſandy</hi> ground; there is ſome little <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion,</hi> but in two or three houres all is gone, it never ſoaks to the <hi>root</hi> of the graſſe: An Hypocrite hath a <hi>root of bitterneſſe</hi> in his <hi>heart,</hi> and all the Dew of Heaven, never ſinks ſo deep as to come to that <hi>root.</hi> Therefore as it is ſaid, in 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. A man that is <hi>borne of God cannot ſinne,</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe the Seed of God abides in him;</hi> he hath a <hi>root</hi> in him: So on the other ſide, an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> he can doe nothing to purpoſe, becauſe there is a <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> in him, there is a <hi>root,</hi> there is a <hi>Coare</hi> at the heart, that the Dew of Heaven never toucheth: Therefore it is a ſigne that thou <hi>ſeeſt</hi> God <hi>aright,</hi> when the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it in thy Soule, goe <hi>through,</hi> and <hi>through,</hi> that they <hi>ſoak</hi> into thy very <hi>ſoule</hi> (as I may ſay) and fetch out thy <hi>inward</hi> luſts.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and laſtly; (and there I ſhall leave at <note place="margin">3 They are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall.</note> this time) theſe <hi>impreſsions</hi> are <hi>univerſall:</hi> An <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,</hi> or a wicked man in time may have <hi>ſome</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon his ſoule, of ſome one thing of God, or ſome few things. As for inſtance, <hi>Judas</hi> had an <hi>impreſsion</hi> upon his heart, and a ſad one too, of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, it made him goe and hang himſelfe: And ſo <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and others; but that was but of one thing. But now a <hi>Saint,</hi> he hath impreſſions of all that is in God; that is, there is nothing in God, but he hath a heart to anſwer it, he hath (as it were, to ſpeak with reverence) a Coppy of God written on his <hi>ſoule;</hi> he hath an impreſſion of the <hi>love</hi> of God, as well as of the <hi>feare</hi> of God; of <hi>delight,</hi> and <hi>truſt</hi> in God, and the like. This is the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53448:34"/> difference betweene a <hi>Saint</hi> of God and an <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite:</hi> Therefore in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. When <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo deſirous to ſee God; <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let me ſee thy glory.</hi> God revealed his glory; and told him his name: <hi>The Lord God, the Lord, mercifull, gracious, long ſuffering, abundant in mercy, keeping mercy for thouſands: Forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſsion, and ſin; and that wil not cleare the guilty; viſiting the ſins of the Fathers upon the Children.</hi> God tells him of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of wicked People; What was this to <hi>Moſes?</hi> God would not tell him halfe his name, but all: Therefore he tells him, what he was to the <hi>Saints, The Lord, gracious, and mercifull, long ſuffering, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in goodneſse, and truth, keeping mercy for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</hi> And then he tels him, what he would be to the wicked; he would have the impreſſion of the whole name of God upon <hi>Moſes.</hi> It is a ſigne thy <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of God are <hi>true,</hi> though they be <hi>weake,</hi> and <hi>ſmall;</hi> when they be <hi>reall,</hi> and <hi>thorow,</hi> and <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall.</hi> The third thing is;</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Expreſsions,</hi> or <hi>Effects</hi> of it: but that I muſt leave till another time.</p>

                     <p>The firſt, was by your <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, was by the <hi>impreſsions</hi> that thoſe apprehenſions of God have upon you.</p>
                     <p>The third thing (which I am now to come to) is by the <hi>Expreſsions</hi> of them, or by their <hi>Effects.</hi> If
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53448:35"/> you would know whether you have ſeene God <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3 By the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of them, which are:</note> or no: I ſay you may know it by the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it: How doth it ſet it ſelfe forth in thee? It works ſomething upon thee; and that vents, and ſhewes it ſelfe ſome way in thy <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>life:</hi> Therefore I finde in Scripture, eſpecially in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of <hi>John,</hi> where much is ſaid of ſeeing God; he brings the Saints uſually to <hi>know</hi> the <hi>ſight</hi> of God by <hi>outward</hi> expreſſions: Becauſe, though it be <hi>cleare</hi> (as I ſaid) yet it is ſo ſmall, that a S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. cannot <hi>alway</hi> ſee it, unleſſe he conſider the <hi>workings</hi> of it alſo upon his heart, and life, as well as his ſingle <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion:</hi> Therefore ſaith he in one place, by this, you ſhall know that you have <hi>ſeene</hi> God, if ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And in another place, <hi>If yee love the Brethren,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now there are theſe foure or five cleare things in Scripture, that demonſtrate a man to be one that hath ſeene God. The firſt is this:</p>
                     <p>If thou haſt ſeene God, certainly the Lord hath <hi>purified</hi> thy heart; the Lord hath given thee a <hi>pure</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Purity of heart.</note> heart: For, ſaith Chriſt, in his firſt Sermon, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart: For they ſhall ſee God.</hi> And in <hi>Heb. 12. Without holineſſe, it is impoſsible to ſee God;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matthew 5.</note> that is a cleare generall rule: And therefore I ſay, thou mayeſt then read, if thou, or I, be a Man, or a Woman, to whom God hath not given a <hi>pure</hi> heart; if God have not <hi>purified thy heart,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, as yet thou haſt not ſeene God: For, if any man ſaith he, hath ſeene God, or that he <hi>walke in the light,</hi> and yet <hi>live</hi> in <hi>ſin, he is a Lyar, and there is no truth in him</hi> at all; you are to give no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to him at all; al his <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> are but fancies.</p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:53448:35"/>
                     <p>Now, the queſtion will be; what is the <hi>purifying</hi> of the heart? Or how may I know that?</p>
                     <p>BELOVED, according to the language of the <note place="margin">What meant by a pure heart.</note> Scripture,: I find that by a <hi>pure</hi> heart, is meant two things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, by a <hi>pure</hi> heart is not ordinarily meant as <note place="margin">1 The conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence purified from guilt of ſinne.</note> you take it, for the killing of ſinne in the ſoule; I ſay not ordinarily: But the chiefe meaning of the <hi>purifying</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> is to have the <hi>conſcience</hi> (for the <hi>heart</hi> is taken for the <hi>conſcience,</hi> to have the conſcience) <hi>purified,</hi> and waſhed from the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſinne: Therefore in <hi>Act.</hi> 15. ſay the Apoſtles, and Elders, Why ſhould we doe thus, and thus with them, <hi>Seeing their hearts, are purified by faith, as well as ours?</hi> That is, ſeeing they <hi>believe</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, and thereby have <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>conſcience</hi> ſetled in their hearts.</p>
                     <p>To cleare, and open this a little to you: There <note place="margin">Conſcience purified, What?</note> are three expreſſions that the holy Ghoſt uſeth in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. that open this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 2. A <hi>pure</hi> heart in this ſence is a man that hath <hi>no conſcience of ſinne;</hi> that is the Scripture language; one that hath no <hi>conſcience of ſinne:</hi> Not as it is commonly in your ſence, one that makes no conſcience of ſinning, one that <hi>continues</hi> in ſinne: But one that hath <hi>no conſcience of ſinne:</hi> That is, one whoſe conſcience is not <hi>ſtained</hi> with the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſinne, but by the bloud of Chriſt, there is a perfect peace ſetled within him; <hi>Peace and joy in believing:</hi> For, that it is to have <hi>conſcience</hi> of ſinne, when alway upon the leaſt <hi>infirmitie,</hi> there is <hi>guilt</hi> heaped upon the <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of a man: Now this is an <hi>impure</hi> heart, an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure</hi> conſcience. And <hi>to the pure every thing is pure,</hi>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:53448:36"/> 
                        <hi>but to the impure, every thing is defiled:</hi> That is, when a man hath an <hi>impure</hi> conſcience, that is not waſhed effectually by the bloud of Chriſt, through the power of the holy Ghoſt; then his <hi>meat,</hi> and his <hi>drinke,</hi> and his <hi>bed,</hi> and his <hi>recreations,</hi> every thing defiles him; every lawfull thing defiles him, as well as unlawfull. Now then thou mayſt reaſon thus; if I have ſeene God, I have a pure heart? What is that? I have <hi>no more conſcience of ſinne:</hi> That is, I finde an exceeding great <hi>power</hi> of the Spirit, that makes my conſcience <hi>cleane,</hi> that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my <hi>frailties,</hi> there is no <hi>guilt</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſoaking in my Conſcence. That is one thing.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond expreſſion, there you ſhall ſee, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards verſe 10. that they are ſaid to be ſanctified; ſanctification in this place, is not meant, as you uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take ſanctification; that is, for <hi>mortification,</hi> and <hi>vivification</hi> (as we ſay) the <hi>killing</hi> of ſin, and the <hi>quickning</hi> of grace, though that may be called ſanctification too: But <hi>ſanctification</hi> in this place is in the ſame ſenſe, as I ſaid before, when the <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is <hi>waſhed</hi> and <hi>cleanſed</hi> from the guilt of ſin, as it is interpreted in the third expreſſion in verſe 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>Let us draw neare with a true heart, in the full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled;</hi> that is, our <hi>conſciences</hi> ſprinkled; <hi>having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water:</hi> An <hi>evill</hi> Conſcience, is <hi>an unbelieving</hi> Conſcience; for, evill in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily taken for <hi>unbeliefe. Take heed</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>leaſt there be in any of you, an evill heart of unbeliefe, to draw back from the living God:</hi> That
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53448:36"/> evill conſcience <hi>Judas</hi> had, and <hi>Saul</hi> had; For, ſin did lye on their conſciences, and was not <hi>waſhed:</hi> Now ſaith he, <hi>Let us draw neare with full aſſurance:</hi> Full aſſurance is oppoſed to an evill Conſcience, and that cannot be, if you take ſanctification in that ſenſe, that you uſe to take it. Now that is one thing; wherever God manifeſts himſelfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals his glory in his Son to the Soule, he gives that man a pure heart, a good conſcience; he <hi>waſheth</hi> that mans conſcience, by the bloud of his Son; that is, his Spirit applies the vertue of the bloud of his Sonne to our Soules, and Conſciences, to make them <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>peaceable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2ly, a pure heart (for there are but two ways in <note place="margin">2 Aheart clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the power of ſin.</note> generall, that it is taken in Scripture, a pure heart) is a heart cleanſed alſo from the power of ſinne; that is a pure heart: And indeed, both are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended here in one word; becauſe whereſoever the one is, the other is alſo: For, it is impoſſible for a man to have his Conſcience made truly <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> by the bloud of Chriſt, but it will be made <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> alſo: Therefore in that place, in <hi>Heb. 12. VVithout holineſſe, it is impoſsible to ſee God.</hi> I ſuppoſe it is meant of <hi>Perſonall</hi> holineſſe, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and amendment of life, and not of the imputed holineſſe of Chriſt, and the waſhing of the conſcience, as I ſaid before.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, if it be ſo, then no man can ſee <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Then ſome ſay, and they ſay truly, that a man <note place="margin">2 The ſtreame of the heart is pure.</note> hath a <hi>pure</hi> heart, though there be <hi>corruption</hi> there, when the <hi>ſtreame</hi> of the heart, the very <hi>ſtreame</hi> of the heart is <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>holy:</hi> Some conceive, and thoſe godly men (as I told you before) that there is a <hi>coare</hi> in the heart of a godly man, that is <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> without ſinne: Which godly men take to be, that that is meant by <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſo frequently in Scripture; ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I ſerve God in my Spirit,</hi> Rom. 1. And, <hi>I pray God to preſerve your ſoule, and body, and ſpirit. 1 Theſſ. 5.</hi> And that <hi>Spirit</hi> they take to be the <hi>quinteſſence</hi> of the ſoule; ſomthing more inward then the Soule: There is ſomthing in a <hi>pure</hi> heart that oppoſeth ſinne, and oppoſeth temptation; there is ſome <hi>non ultra</hi> in the heart of a godly man: Sinne gets the advantage over his eyes, and over his hand, and over his tongue; but there is a baracado in his heart that it can goe no farther.</p>

                     <p>There is one thing briefly, that I deſire you to thinke on. <note place="margin">2 It changeth them to the ſame image.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Againe, whoſoever hath ſeene God, a ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it is this; he is tranſlated into the <hi>ſame image</hi> with God, to that which he ſeeth; As you have it, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. ult.</hi> Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>All we with open face</hi> (that is) al the Saints, <hi>we behold as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, and are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> We behold the glory of the Lord, and are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory; I was going to tell you the laſt time, how the ſight
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53448:38"/> of God hath a twofold <hi>impreſsion</hi> upon us. I forgot the laſt, and it will not be unſeaſonable to mind you of it now.</p>
                     <p>The firſt was, I told you, it works in us a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <hi>ſnitable</hi> to what we ſee in God, if God be <hi>great,</hi> it makes me <hi>little;</hi> if he be juſt, it makes me feare; if he be faithfull, it makes me truſt; if he be good, it makes me love him; and the like.</p>
                     <p>Now the Second is this;</p>
                     <p>Whatſoever a <hi>Saint ſees</hi> in God, it works ſome reſemblance in him of what he <hi>ſees,</hi> not a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſſe; for greatneſſe in God, and <hi>feare</hi> in me, that ſuits; God is great and I feare him. But here I ſay, it works a reſemblance in a kinde: As when I ſee the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of God, it works and raiſeth my Spirit to a holy <hi>greatneſſe;</hi> if I ſee holineſſe in God, it makes me <hi>holy;</hi> there is nothing in God that is ſeene, but it works a <hi>Reſemblance,</hi> except it be <hi>humility,</hi> of which I ſhall ſhew the reaſon after. All the <hi>Attributes</hi> in God, become <hi>graces</hi> in you; <hi>goodneſſe</hi> in God, makes you <hi>good;</hi> but your <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> is a <hi>grace;</hi> and his, is an <hi>Attribute:</hi> But only I ſay <hi>humilitie,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of God makes me humble; the <hi>glory</hi> of God makes me not <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>high,</hi> but <hi>low,</hi> and <hi>humble:</hi> But every other thing in God makes me frame my heart, and life, juſt like God. <note place="margin">Creatures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of ſpirituall things.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And there is no wonder in this, we ſee in the Creatures (for the Creatures are a reſemblance of ſpirituall things:) The Creatures are ſo caſt by God, as that they might be fit <hi>reſemblances,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions</hi> of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things in his word. <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſheep only by the working of <hi>fancie,</hi> by <hi>looking</hi> upon the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53448:39"/> 
                        <hi>rods</hi> it made them conceive: If <hi>fancy</hi> work ſo, as that <hi>looking</hi> upon any thing, it could make ſuch an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion;</hi> much more <hi>faith</hi> looking upon ſuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious object as God, that hath ſuch fulneſſe in him, ſhall make the ſoule like that it ſees. Therefore in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>We have ſeene his glory, as the glory of the only begotten ſonne of God, full of grace, and truth, and of his fulneſſe, we all receive grace for grace. VVe ſaw</hi> his glory, and of that <hi>full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of <hi>glory,</hi> we receive <hi>grace</hi> for <hi>grace,</hi> as the <hi>VVax</hi> receives <hi>letter</hi> for <hi>letter</hi> from the <hi>Seale;</hi> or as the <hi>child</hi> receives <hi>lymb</hi> for <hi>lymb</hi> from the Parent; ſo we receive <hi>grace</hi> for <hi>grace</hi> from Chriſt: There is never a <hi>grace</hi> that we ſee in Chriſt, but the <hi>ſeeing</hi> it with a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> eye, works and creates ſuch a grace in our Soules.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I pray conſider of this, whether you <note place="margin">Triall of a right ſight of God.</note> have had ſuch a ſight of God, that when you <hi>ſee</hi> this, it hath framed your ſoules according to God, that you are <hi>like</hi> him: If you ſay, you <hi>ſee</hi> God, and it is only a <hi>drie ſpeculation,</hi> that leaves you <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>carnall,</hi> and <hi>malicious,</hi> and <hi>high minded,</hi> and <hi>froward,</hi> and the like, without working on you, what you <hi>ſee</hi> in God, you may juſtly ſuſpect it not to be right.</p>
                     <p>A third expreſſion, I find in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 12. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <note place="margin">3 A right ſight of God works love to our Brethren.</note> hath <hi>ſeene</hi> God, loves his Brother. <hi>No man hath ſeene God at any time, if we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</hi> I told you before, that to <hi>ſee</hi> God, and to <hi>dwell</hi> in God, are taken for one another: As he ſaith after, verſe 15. <hi>VVhoſoever ſhall confeſſe, that Jeſus is the Sonne of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God:</hi> and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53448:39"/> verſe 16. <hi>He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him: No man hath ſeen God at any time, but he that loveth his brother, God dwelleth in him.</hi> What is that? That is; he hath ſeen God: For, as I ſaid they are all one, <hi>dwelling in God,</hi> and <hi>ſeeing</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>Therefore looke to that, whether God have wrought in you, a heart Spiritually and purely to <note place="margin">How Saints ſhould be loved.</note> love the <hi>Saints,</hi> as <hi>Saints;</hi> not to love them, that they may love me; or to love them, becauſe they have a great deale of credit, that they may report well of me, or to love them <hi>carnally;</hi> but whether I frame my heart to love the <hi>Saints,</hi> as <hi>Saints,</hi> as <hi>elect</hi> perſons, <hi>choſen</hi> of God, and <hi>Members</hi> of Chriſt, and as he beares the <hi>image</hi> of Chriſt on his ſoule: if I love not my Brother, ſurely I have never ſeene God; therefore it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 11. He that hateh his Brother is in darkneſſe, he walketh in darkneſſe, and knoweth not whether he goeth.</hi> What <hi>darkneſſe?</hi> Compare it with the firſt chap. verſe 6, 7. that <hi>darkneſſe</hi> is oppoſite to <hi>Fellowſhip in light</hi> with God, and Chriſt: If a man love not his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let him be a <hi>wiſe</hi> man, let him be a <hi>Scholler,</hi> let him <hi>repeat</hi> Sermons, &amp;c. he is in <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> and goes he knowes not whether; for a man goes he knows not whether, that hath not <hi>ſeene</hi> God, he goes in <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> and muſt wander for ever more: Looke a little on your hearts, and aske the queſtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your converſation, whether you love the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God or no, That is the third thing.</p>
                     <p>Then fourthly (which depends upon this) who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <note place="margin">4 Fellowſhip with the Saints.</note> hath ſeene God rightly; as he loves the Saints, ſo he hath Goſpell <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with the <hi>Saints;</hi> I ſay, he hath <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> with the <hi>Saints, 1 Joh.</hi> 1. 7.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53448:40"/> For there is a diſcourſe concerning this <hi>ſeeing</hi> of God, <hi>Truly</hi> ſaith <hi>John</hi> verſe 3. <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and theſe things we write unto you, that your joy may be full. But if we ſay we have Fellowſhip with him, and walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we lye, and doe not the truth:</hi> If we ſay we have <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with him, and walke in <hi>ſinne; But if wee walke in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one with another, and the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt his</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Whence the Fellowſhip of Saints is.</note> 
                        <hi>Son, cleanſeth us from all ſinne.</hi> Underſtand me, I meane not here by <hi>fellowſhip,</hi> and I ſuppoſe it is not meant here, <hi>fellowſhip</hi> of <hi>neighbourhood,</hi> or <hi>fellowſhip</hi> of the <hi>family,</hi> or <hi>fellowſhip</hi> of the ſame City; no, nor being of the ſame outward viſible <hi>Church,</hi> I thinke that is not meant, though that be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But, <hi>VVe have fellowſhip one with another.</hi> What is that? That is when I have ſeene God, and have had <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with God, and his ſonne Jeſus Chriſt, I have a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> fellowſhip with all that have ſeene God with me; that is, the ground of the <hi>fellowſhip</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> I have with others, is in that they have ſeene God as well as I; and the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion</hi> of God is cleare on their ſpirits, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in their lives.</p>
                     <p>Therefore for People to have <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with <note place="margin">Fellowſhip on wrong grounds.</note> others in this, or that <hi>reſpect,</hi> becauſe they jump with them in this, or that opinion, or in this or that way; this is not the Fellowſhip ſpoken of by <hi>John</hi> and by <hi>Paul, Philip.</hi> 1. 4, 5. But this Fellowſhip is a higher thing; the <hi>ſpiritual communion,</hi> we have one with another, upon ſpirituall grounds, becauſe of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God dwelling in us. Therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelves by this; Have you any <hi>fellowſhip</hi>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:53448:40"/> with the Saints? Is not the Fellowſhip of divers of you (why ſhould I aske the queſtion, I know it is ſo) with <hi>Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Malignants,</hi> thoſe that <hi>raile</hi> againſt godlineſſe, thoſe that <hi>blaſpheme</hi> God, and his People, this is the <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> of many. And it may be others of you have <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> but it is carnall; that is, it is grounded on carnall reſpects, it is not, becauſe they have ſeene God, and you have ſeene him alſo, and therefore you have Fellowſhip together. That is another thing.</p>
                     <p>A fifth thing I find, that I will but touch; That whoſoever hath <hi>ſeene</hi> God, they are very deſirous <note place="margin">5 Deſire to bring others to the light.</note> to bring all others into the ſame light that they have ſeene: O! how oft doth <hi>Paul</hi> upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, concerning his viſion, how oft doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it at large in the acts of the Apoſtles, how he had ſeene God! And ſo here <hi>John,</hi> when he had ſeene the <hi>glory</hi> of God, he <hi>writes</hi> to them, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the meſſage to them, and he would bring them alſo to the <hi>light,</hi> to walke in the <hi>light</hi> as he did. Beloved, a man that hath <hi>ſeene</hi> God once <hi>truly,</hi> he looks upon all the world, as People walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Hell, in a hell of darkneſſe; the courſe of mankind in this world, is but as a <hi>Hell</hi> to him: Therefore to ſee People walke in ſuch groſſe <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and God having broken in a little Window into his ſoule, he cannot chooſe but bring others to the <hi>light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore I never believed, nor doe believe, <note place="margin">Chriſtians ſhould be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> when People among us (it may be they are godly, I leave them to the Lord) that profeſſe they <hi>ſee</hi> a great deale of <hi>light,</hi> and they <hi>ſee</hi> God more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53448:41"/> and yet for the <hi>expreſsion</hi> of it, we ſee they withdraw and goe aſide, and they thinke it not fit to teach <hi>carnall</hi> men; it may be they will teach one another, three or foure, or five; Not as though I blamed <hi>teaching,</hi> let us teach one another any how, ſo we may <hi>edifie</hi> one another in the Lord <hi>publickly,</hi> or privately; but when there is a ſpirit in People, that they will not <hi>communicate</hi> the <hi>light</hi> as much as they can, that other poor ſinners may <hi>ſee</hi> it, I ſuſpect that <hi>light,</hi> that it is not from God; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſees the <hi>Light</hi> rightly, he will doe his utmoſt Endeavour to bring others into the <hi>Light.</hi>

                     <p>But laſtly, I find, that whoſoever hath <hi>ſeene</hi> God truly, that <hi>ſight</hi> of God will make him able to goe through any hardſhip, any ſuffering, any affliction whatſoever, in the ſervice of God. As in <hi>Heb. 11. 27. Moſes forſooke Aegypt, and regarded not the wrath</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Moſes</note> 
                        <hi>of the King: but endured,</hi> ſaith the text. Why did he? Did he not know what the <hi>wrath</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> was? No doubt, but he ſaw what a <hi>Tyrant</hi> he was, and he ſaw much cruelty, living in the Houſe, but <hi>he endured, as ſeeing him who is inviſible;</hi> he ſaw God, and ſo he was able to goe through all. And ſo <hi>Stephen,</hi> that bleſſed man, that was <hi>full of the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Stephen.</note> 
                        <hi>holy Ghoſt Acts</hi> 7: When he had preached unto them, ſaith the text, <hi>they were cut to their hearts and gnaſhed on him with their teeth, and he being full of the holy Ghoſt, looked ſtedfaſtly to Heaven, and ſaw the glory of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, ſtanding on the right hand of God.</hi> When they <hi>gnaſhed</hi> their teeth, he looked up to heaven, &amp; ſaw God, and Chriſt at his right hand. It may be there was ſomthing that was <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:53448:41"/> but it is a worke that is <hi>ordinary. Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſee the Heavens opened, and the Sonne of man ſtanding on the right hand of God.</hi> Then they cryed out, and ſtopped their eares, and ſtoned him; and he called on God, and ſaid, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit, and kneeled downe, and cried, Lord lay not this ſinne to their charge.</hi> See how <hi>Stephen</hi> was calling on God, and <hi>praying</hi> for his enemies, and giving up his Spirit to God, when they were <hi>gnaſhing</hi> with their teeth, and ſtoning him as if they had been mad, yet he goes through it quietly.</p>
                     <p>Whatſoever pretences men have, this is the <note place="margin">Why ſome Profeſſors avoid ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> reaſon why many Profeſſors are ſo wiſe, that they will never ſuffer perſecution, let the world turne which way it will, they will not want <hi>diſtinctions</hi> to <hi>waue</hi> perſecution; the truth is they wave it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not ſeene God, if they had, they would carry themſelves <hi>innocently,</hi> and <hi>prudently,</hi> and then let what would come.</p>

                     <p>Now laſtly, in a few words, becauſe you have partly heard it before, therefore I will be the briefer.</p>

                     <p>Therefore if thou wilt <hi>ſee</hi> God, thou muſt not thinke to doe it, as to finde out a <hi>controverſie</hi> in <hi>Divinity;</hi> or to to know a <hi>myſtery</hi> in a <hi>Trade;</hi> it is not thy ſtudie, and ſtraining of thy witt, thou mayeſt doe that if thou wilt: But deſire of God,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53448:43"/> to frame the <hi>new</hi> creature in thee; thou muſt not only have other things preſented before theſe eyes, but thou muſt have another paire of eyes to ſee things, another <hi>underſtanding,</hi> other <hi>principles,</hi> a <hi>new creature</hi> framed in thy heart; that is the force of the argument of Chriſt to <hi>Nicodemus Joh. 3. Except a man be borne againe, he cannot ſee the Kingdome of God.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I know thou art a great ſtudent, and thou takeſt paines to goe to Heaven; but I will deale plainly with thee, thou muſt be borne of God, thou muſt be a <hi>new</hi> creature, or elſe thou mayſt ſtudy all thy life, thou mayſt ſtudy thy heart out, and it will not doe; therefore beg of God to make thee a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: He is the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſſe,</hi> that can ſhine where he pleaſeth; the bleſſed Spirit is that <hi>wind</hi> that <hi>bloweth where it liſteth:</hi> He muſt make thee a new creature, or elſe thou haſt no faculty to <hi>behold</hi> him. For, if God ſhould ſhine upon the <hi>old</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thou haſt no more <hi>eyes</hi> to ſee him, then a <hi>blind</hi> man to behold the <hi>light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in this order of ſeeing God, (which is <note place="margin">3 God muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from Satans King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> all of his free grace to doe this, I only ſhew you the author of it, it is none of it in thy power) get the Lord to deliver thee from the <hi>Kingdome of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> or elſe thou canſt never ſee him. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Devill,</hi> is a Kingdome of <hi>darkneſſe;</hi> ſo darke, that as long as a man lives in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <note place="margin">Satans King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> he is never like to ſee any thing of God. Therefore if thou wilt <hi>ſee</hi> God, or ſpirituall things, labour to come into that Kingdom where <hi>light</hi> ſhines. There are ſome Nations in the <hi>North,</hi> that they have halfe the yeare <hi>night,</hi> it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53448:43"/> a Kingdome of darkneſſe, a man though he have eyes, cannot ſee there: So the <hi>Devils King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> is a Kingdome of darkneſſe, and marke it, as farre as there is <hi>darkneſſe</hi> in any ſoule, ſo farre the <hi>Devils</hi> Kingdome is there. For, the <hi>Devill</hi> hath no <hi>bodily,</hi> outward <hi>Kingdome,</hi> of <hi>Lands,</hi> and <hi>eſtates,</hi> and <hi>revenues;</hi> but <hi>darkneſſe</hi> is his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and ſo much <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> ſo much inheritance the <hi>Devill</hi> hath: That is the reaſon, that where there is none of the Goſpell, the Devill hath a great Kingdome; he hath a <hi>great</hi> Kingdome in <hi>VVales,</hi> and in the <hi>north</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe there is a great deale of darkneſſe there: therefore doe thou deſire the Lord to tranſlate thee out <hi>of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darkneſſe, to the Kingdome of his deare Sonne.</hi> See this in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If our Goſpell be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt:</hi> He ſpeaks of unfruitfull hearing of the word, there is no fault in the Goſpell; but it is a ſigne that they are a People that muſt periſh, that the Goſpell can doe them no good, <hi>In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not; leaſt the light of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine upon them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How came it to paſſe that the Goſpell that <hi>Paul</hi> preached, did the Soules of the People no more good? <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, the fault was not in the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> the <hi>Goſpell</hi> was <hi>pleaſing</hi> to God however: but the <hi>God of this world;</hi> that is, the <hi>Devill,</hi> the <hi>Devill</hi> of <note place="margin">Why the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is called the God of this world.</note> 
                        <hi>Hell</hi> as you call him: God calls him, <hi>the God of this world;</hi> not becauſe he is abſolute, and may doe what he will: but he is under Gods power, and God gives him ſuch a <hi>ſtroake,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> as if he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53448:44"/> were a God in the world; he hath ſo many Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ſuch pollicie, and ſpirits; <hi>The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not:</hi> that is, they were blind before, but he hath made them more blind.</p>
                     <p>O conſider this! thou wert blind, before thou didſt heare the Goſpell: but when a man heares the Goſpell, that <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>darkneſſe;</hi> that is, the <hi>Devill,</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> he blinds thy minde more, and more; he draws a new vaile over thy eyes, Why ſo? <hi>That the light of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt, who is the image of God ſhould not ſhine on them.</hi> He drawes the <hi>Curtaine,</hi> that the <hi>Sun</hi> may not come on them; that the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God in Chriſt may not come on them: Therefore conſider what a <hi>Monarch</hi> the Devill is, and how <hi>great</hi> the Kingdom of the Devill is in thee. And if ever thou come to the <hi>light,</hi> deſire God to <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate</hi> thee <hi>into the Kingdome of his deare ſonne,</hi> that Kingdome is all light. As far as there is a cleare <hi>light</hi> in my Soule, ſo far Chriſt hath his Kingdome in me.</p>
                     <p>Then, if thou wilt ſee God, thou muſt labour <note place="margin">4 Purity of heart.</note> to be <hi>pure</hi> in heart, as I told you: for, <hi>without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> Let a prophane man uſe all the meanes in the world, as long as he is ſo, he ſhall never ſee God.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, thou muſt <hi>looke</hi> for the <hi>ſhining</hi> of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> glorious <hi>Sun,</hi> through the Word, and by the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> It muſt come through the <hi>VVord;</hi> and expect the Spirit to bring it, or elſe it will never ſhine upon thy Soule. This, in few words, is the <hi>ſeries,</hi> or <hi>order,</hi> in which God <hi>manifeſts himſelfe</hi> to his people.</p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:53448:44"/>
                     <p>I will now conclude only with this word, It may be thou wilt ſay, I hope I have <hi>ſeene</hi> God, and I remember the Lord did <hi>manifeſt</hi> himſelf to me; but truly it is but a little.</p>
                     <p>I will ſpeake but a word to you that have <hi>ſeene</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe</hi> Thoſe that have ſeen God ſhould walke holily.</note> God. I beſeech you walk like People that are <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> God; Gods eye is upon you, and you have <hi>ſeene him;</hi> walke uprightly, walk not like the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>world;</hi> for ye are <hi>lyars</hi> if you doe: if you ſay that you have <hi>ſeene</hi> God, and walke in <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> and walke in <hi>ſinne,</hi> you are <hi>lyars,</hi> and there is no truth in you. O! walke <hi>holily;</hi> and labour more, and more to ſee God, as <hi>Paul</hi> did; he <hi>forgate that which was behind,</hi> and would ſee <hi>more</hi> of God; more of his glory: that is the meaning of that word in <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. ſaith Chriſt to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: for, he ſpake not to wicked People at that time. <hi>He that hath my Commandements, and keepeth them, loveth me, and he ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelfe to him.</hi> Without doubt, God had manifeſted himſelfe to theſe before, they were <hi>Saints</hi> before: but he meanes, I will manifeſt my ſelfe <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>more;</hi> but they muſt <hi>love</hi> him, and <hi>keepe</hi> his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> The meaning is not that you ſhall finde the Commandements of God, and the things of God, are as a bottome of Thred, that is all ſhufled together, that you can finde no end of it, you thinke to have an end, and yet you cannot, and you thinke to finde a place where to get all grace; whereas notwithſtanding, if you had all the gifts in this world, you cannot keepe the <hi>Commandements:</hi> but the meaning is, you ſhall
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53448:45"/> finde in the things of God, that God hath made <hi>one</hi> thing the <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>another,</hi> if you <hi>love</hi> God, you will <hi>keepe</hi> his Commandements, and if you <hi>keepe</hi> his Commandements you <hi>love</hi> God. I ſay, God hath made one thing the condition of <hi>another,</hi> to whet us on, if you keep my <hi>Commandements,</hi> you love me, and if you <hi>love</hi> me, I will <hi>manifeſt</hi> my ſelfe to you.</p>
                     <p>So I know by experience, though all be by free grace, yet the People of God, by making one thing the condition of another, it hath made their Journey, that they have not been weary. Though <hi>Heaven</hi> be the <hi>reward</hi> of all, yet God hath made <hi>little baits</hi> for us. The great reward is, <hi>He that holds out to the end ſhall be ſaved:</hi> but that is a great way <hi>off,</hi> and we are <hi>weake,</hi> and cannot ſee a farre off; therefore God hath made little <hi>baits,</hi> and little <hi>rewards; He that loves me, I will manifeſt my ſelfe to him.</hi> A weake Saint may doe that: ſo that is the meaning, though God doth all by his free grace, yet God doth uſe meanes to get us on. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God may manifeſt himſelfe more, and more to thee; labour to keepe his <hi>commandements;</hi> labour to be more holy this weeke, then the laſt: <hi>Add to faith, virtue; to virtue, patience; to patience, temperance,</hi> &amp;c. God teacheth us, as we teach our Children, <hi>one</hi> letter after <hi>another,</hi> add <hi>ſuch</hi> a grace, and <hi>ſuch</hi> a grace, <hi>If theſe things be in you, and abound, ye ſhall not be barren, and unfruitfull: but ſhall be able to ſee a farre off.</hi> What a farre off? Things that are farre off, are hardly ſeene; and of all things, the glory of God in Chriſt, is the hardeſt.</p>
                     <p>Now if you add one grace to another, by the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53448:45"/> aſſiſtance of God, and endeavouring to keepe his <hi>Commandements,</hi> and to walke in your callings, as you are <hi>Huſband,</hi> or <hi>VVife,</hi> or <hi>Maſter,</hi> or <hi>Servant,</hi> or <hi>Tradeſman,</hi> &amp;c. if you endeavour to do that which is <hi>pleaſing</hi> in <hi>Gods</hi> eye, <hi>God</hi> will reveale himſelfe more and more clearly and fully to your ſoules.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the firſt, I opened it, and proved it to you, and have already made ſeverall uſes of it. The laſt uſe was, to examine your ſelves, whether God have beſtowed this priviledge upon you, or no. And that I ſhewed you is to be known.</p>
                     <p>By your <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of it.</p>

                     <p>By the <hi>expreſsions</hi> of it, as it ſhewes it ſelfe in your lives.</p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:53448:47"/>
                     <p>I have but two words of uſes farther of that Doctrine, and ſo I ſhall proceed to the other.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you may learne hence the <hi>reaſon</hi> of that great <hi>difference</hi> of temper, and life that is between <note place="margin">1 Reaſon of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene godly and wicked.</note> 
                        <hi>godly</hi> men, and <hi>wicked</hi> men. Godly men, and wicked men uſe often to wonder one at another, as if they were Monſters; Godly men doe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the lives of carnall men, and at their temper, how they can <hi>laugh,</hi> and be <hi>merry,</hi> when they are ready to drop into Hell; and that they are <hi>merry,</hi> and joyfull, when they know they are in the hands of the Devill. And wicked men uſually wonder at the Saints, to ſee them <hi>ſad,</hi> and <hi>weep,</hi> and <hi>mourne,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>Beloved, the main thing, that makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene their temper, and life, it is this: <note place="margin">Wicked men live on earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things.</note> the one <hi>lives</hi> wholly upon baſe <hi>earthly</hi> things, as <hi>credit,</hi> and <hi>preferment,</hi> and wealth, and the like; and the other wholly <hi>lives</hi> upon the <hi>face</hi> of God, upon the ſeeing of God. Give a carnall man <hi>credit</hi> enough, and honour enough; commend him high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, give him money, and meanes, and trading, and <note place="margin">A Saint lives by ſeeing Gods face.</note> wealth, and there he lives; then he hath a good life, then he is as a Fiſh in the water. Now the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>ſees</hi> the <hi>face</hi> of God in Jeſus Chriſt, though you put him in a cold <hi>Priſon,</hi> in iron chains, yet he is alive: Then give him <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>credit,</hi> he cares not a ſtraw for them, if Gods <hi>face</hi> be <hi>hid:</hi> Therefore ſaith David, <hi>Pſal. 4. There be many that will ſay, who will ſhew us any good?</hi> That is, <hi>worldly</hi> men will aske, who will ſhew us a good <hi>bargaine?</hi> what courſe ſhall we take to encreaſe our <hi>trade?</hi> what courſe ſhall we take to be <hi>happy,</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:53448:47"/> and <hi>rich,</hi> &amp; the like? Saith <hi>David,</hi> Lord, I wil none of this, I am of another temper, my whole deſire is, that thy bleſſed <hi>face</hi> may ſhine for ever on me.</p>
                     <p>This is the reaſon why <hi>carnall</hi> men <hi>wonder</hi> at the <hi>Saints,</hi> and that the Saints in a ſort wonder at them. Nay, this is the reaſon why there is ſuch a great difference betweene a Saint and himſelfe; <note place="margin">Why Saints differ from themſelves ſometimes.</note> not only between him, and <hi>wicked</hi> men, but between him and <hi>himſelf.</hi> A Saint, O! how full of joy is he one day, when (it may be) his <hi>houſe</hi> is bare enough, and his <hi>clothes</hi> are bare enough, and he is full of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,</hi> yet he is full of <hi>joy,</hi> and ſweetneſſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Another time, it may be it is better with him in the world without, yet he is full of <hi>heavineſſe,</hi> and ſadneſſe, and ſorrow, and ſighing: the reaſon is, the one day the Lord <hi>ſhines,</hi> upon his ſoule, but now the Lord <hi>hides</hi> himſelfe; now when the Lord <hi>ſhines</hi> upon him, he is full of <hi>joy;</hi> but when the Lord hides himſelfe he is full of trouble, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith. This is one word for your information.</p>
                     <p>There is another word for <hi>exhortation,</hi> and ſo I conclude this leſſon, the exhortation is this. All <note place="margin">1 Not to envy wicked mens proſperity.</note> you that are Saints, and doe ſee the wicked <hi>proſper,</hi> and it may be you ſhall ſee it more and more hereafter, unleſſe God worke wonders; you ſhall ſee the <hi>wicked</hi> poſper, and <hi>Hypocrites</hi> proſper, and have more <hi>honour,</hi> and more <hi>wealth,</hi> and more <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,</hi> and the like. Beloved, my exhortation to you is, that you would no way envy them, but rather pitty them. Why ſo? Why? becauſe this is all their <hi>Portion,</hi> and your Portion that God hath given you, is infinitly, incomparably beyond their Portion, your Portion, what is it? I remember
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53448:48"/> as the Lord ſaith in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> of the <hi>Levites,</hi> they had no <hi>portion</hi> or <hi>inheritance with the People,</hi> but ſaith he, <hi>I am their portion;</hi> and as it is ſaid of <hi>Elkana</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Hannah,</hi> he gave her <hi>a worthy portion;</hi> he <hi>loved</hi> her, though <hi>Peninnah</hi> bare him <hi>Children,</hi> he <hi>loved Hannah</hi> that was a <hi>worthy portion:</hi> So you have a portion, that theirs, holds no compariſon with; that is, though you have nothing in the world elſe, yet you have portion enough, that Gods <hi>face</hi> ſhineth on you; that God in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, many wayes, and many times, makes <hi>knowne</hi> himſelfe to you in a ſpeciall manner through Chriſt, therefore envy them not, but pitty them; you that have taſted this by your owne experience, I appeale to you, (becauſe you will hardly believe, but that they are happy people) there are none of <note place="margin">Saints ſadnes in deſertion.</note> you that ever have <hi>ſeene</hi> God, but ſometime or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God hath hid his face; &amp; it may be hath given theſe things of the world, at that time, he hath given you <hi>credit,</hi> much credit, and <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>wealth,</hi> good <hi>meat,</hi> and brave cloathes, but he hath hid his face. I pray how <hi>merry</hi> were you in thoſe dayes, in that weeke when God did ſo, when you had meat, and brave cloathes, and the like? you know you were weary of your lives for all theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then judge what is to be thought of a poor carnall man that hath no other all his life long. Only, this makes it a little more bitter to you, becauſe they know no better, and you doe; they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>merryment,</hi> and drunkenneſſe, and eating, and drinking, and roaring: Judge you by that weeke, or fortnight that you were in <hi>deſertion,</hi> and yet had the good things of the <hi>World,</hi> what
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53448:48"/> the comfort of an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and a <hi>worldly</hi> man is all his life; envy them not. It is hard to learn this leſſon, doe not ſay you are neglected, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and you can hardly live in the world, and every baſe <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> and every <hi>Hypocrite</hi> he gets up. Let him goe, and ſay with <hi>David,</hi> the Lord hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed a <hi>faire portion</hi> on you, he comes once, or twice, or thrice a day in Jeſus Chriſt to <hi>looke</hi> upon you: lay up theſe things. So I have done with that Leſſon.</p>
                     <p>Now I come to the next doctrine.</p>
                     <p>You have heard in the former point, that a Saint hath a peculiar, ſpeciall ſight of God in this world.</p>
                     <p>Now the next Leſſon is that, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The ſight of God in Chriſt, the way to true humiliation</note>

                     <p>Firſt, that when I ſpeak of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> becauſe it hath many ſenſes, and is taken variouſly, I doe not underſtand it as one act, for a <hi>faſt</hi> day, or a day
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53448:49"/> of <hi>humiliation</hi> as you call it, to <hi>hang downe the head like a Bulruſh,</hi> or in a <hi>preparatorie</hi> way to make a man fit for Chriſt or the like; whether that be right or no, I ſpeake not now. But I ſpeak of that <note place="margin">1 What humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, here meant.</note> grace of humiliation; that is, that gracious hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of heart in a Saint, that in Scripture is ſo called, when men are ſaid to be humble: it is a grace that is never away from a Saint; we ſhould be cloathed with it as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith: I am to ſpeake of it in that ſence; it is the gracious, lowly, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall humble <hi>frame</hi> of heart that is in a Saint, and is in no wicked man, nor can be, as I ſhall ſhew afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, when I am ſpeaking, that the ſight of God in Chriſt humbleth the ſoule, you muſt not <note place="margin">2 Other meanes of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on excluded.</note> miſtake here, and thinke that I <hi>exclude</hi> other <hi>meanes,</hi> inferiour meanes: For I told you before, as God ſhews himſelfe by any <hi>meanes,</hi> by any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by any providence, or any way: So he may ſo ſhew himſelf that way, that he may <hi>humble</hi> you in that way. Therefore you muſt not ſay, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſpeake againſt <hi>meanes,</hi> becauſe I ſay the <hi>ſight</hi> of God doth humble a Saint; for I exclude not other meanes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and in a ſpeciall manner take notice, <note place="margin">3 Sight of God doth humble occaſionally.</note> that this ſight of God; the <hi>ſeeing</hi> God of as Saints doe ſee him, doth not properly humble the ſoule of a man, but occaſionally as it were. It doth it not properly: becauſe you know that in Heaven; when we ſhall be in Heaven, we doe not read that we ſhall then be <hi>humbled.</hi> We ſhall then be in a ſtate of glory every way, and yet we ſhall <hi>ſee</hi> God there more then ever we did before. But (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53448:49"/> the <hi>ſight</hi> of God <hi>humbleth</hi> us here <hi>occaſionally;</hi> that is, by reaſon of the <hi>frailtie,</hi> and <hi>corruption</hi> that is upon us. Juſt as the Law made <hi>Paul</hi> to ſinne more, <hi>Rom. 7. Sinn taking occaſion by the Law:</hi> So I ſay, becauſe we are fraile and <hi>weake,</hi> and vile, and ſinfull, every apprehenſion of a <hi>glorious,</hi> and great and powerfull God <hi>abaſeth,</hi> and humbleth us, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 8. when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw a little of God in Chriſt, working a myracle (for I told you God many wayes, by any meanes can reveale himſelf to the ſoule of a Saint) ſaith he, <hi>Lord depart from me, I am a ſinfull man. Peters</hi> heart was taken downe, and he was amazed to ſee the glory of God, and why ſo? becauſe he conſidered he was a <hi>ſinfull</hi> man; that threw him downe, and humbled him. Now theſe three things being laid downe before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall briefly in a word prove this leſſon, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 5, 6. when <hi>Job</hi> had ſeen God, it humbled him. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the eare, but now mine eye ſeeth thee; wherefore I abhorre my ſelfe, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Peter, Luke 22. 61, 62. Peter</hi> having a glance of Chriſt, Chriſt, <hi>looked</hi> on him; and he <hi>ſeeing</hi> his Maſter looke on him, he went out, and <hi>wept bitterly. Paul</hi> having ſeene the Lord, he was ſtricken downe from his Horſe, and cried <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to doe?</hi> though God manifeſted himſelfe variouſly; and their <hi>humiliation</hi> is variouſly expreſt, and ſet forth in Scripture; yet it is but one, and the ſame thing; ſo it holds true, that this ſight of God doth truly humble the ſoule.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall in the next place ſhew you two things.</p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:53448:50"/>
                     <p>Firſt, I ſhall give you ſome reaſons to prove that it is ſo.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, ſhew you ſomewhat, why it is ſo.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the firſt, I ſhall give you but theſe two or three reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, I finde clearly in Scripture, that God <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. All graces wrought by ſeeing of God.</note> works all <hi>graces</hi> in the ſoules of his Saints, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him; I ſay, I find clearly in Scripture that every <hi>grace</hi> that is wrought in the heart of a Saint, is wrought by <hi>beholding</hi> God in Chriſt; and if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other grace be wrought thus; why not this? As for inſtance.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for <hi>holines,</hi> take it in a general ſence 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <note place="margin">Holineſſe.</note> 
                        <hi>ult. VVe all with open face, behold as in a gloſſe the glory of the Lord in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We behold the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God as in a glaſſe, <hi>and are changed into the ſame image;</hi> that is, we are made like unto Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>holy,</hi> as he is <hi>holy, we are changed from glory, to glory;</hi> that is, by <hi>beholding</hi> the glory of God in Jeſus Chriſt, we are made <hi>holy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then you ſhall ſee for <hi>patience,</hi> that comes into the ſoule, by beholding God in Chriſt; as <note place="margin">Patience.</note> you ſhall have it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 27. It is ſaid that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he endured, and feared not the wrath of the King; he endured, as ſeeing him who is inviſible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How did <hi>Moſes</hi> endure all the threatnings of <hi>Pharaoh?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lord revealed himſelfe to his Soule, and by the grace of God, the Lord wrought him to a <hi>patiently</hi> bearing of all his threatnings. So <hi>Stephen</hi> in <hi>Act. 7. He ſaw Jeſus Chriſt ſit at the right hand of glory,</hi> and then he did quietly fall on his knees,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53448:50"/> to pray for his enemies, when they were ſtoning him to death.</p>
                     <p>So alſo for <hi>faith;</hi> how wil you have <hi>faith</hi> ſee in <hi>Heb.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Faith.</note> 12. 2. <hi>Looking to Jeſus the author, and ſiniſher of our faith.</hi> We have not faith of our ſelves; neither can we make a <hi>faith</hi> of our ſelves, but by <hi>beholding</hi> of Chriſt; the <hi>Lord</hi> works <hi>faith</hi> in our hearts to receive <note place="margin">Wiſdome.</note> him. So, alſo I might ſhew, of <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and of <hi>ſtrength,</hi> as you may ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 23, 24. an obſervable place, <note place="margin">Strength.</note> Chriſt would have them to looke upon him, <hi>Looke to me and be ſaved, ſurely ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſnes, and ſtrength.</hi> Chriſt bids them looke to him, and then they ſhall crie out, they have <hi>ſtrength.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. you ſhall ſee that all graces are put together, <hi>VVe beheld his glory, as the glory of the only begotten Sonne of God, and out of his fullneſſe, we all receive grace for grace.</hi> By beholding the glory of God in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>we receive grace for grace,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt hath, we have it, as they ſay, the Paper receives the print from the Preſſe. Now, beloved, if this be the ordinary way in Scripture to beget all other <hi>graces</hi> in the ſoule, then why not the way to <hi>humble</hi> the ſoule before God?</p>
                     <p>Only with this difference, which is worth your <note place="margin">Difference in the working of humilia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, and other graces.</note> obſerving, that every other grace is wrought in the ſoule, by a kinde of aſſimilation; but this is wrought in a contrary way. I mean thus, by <hi>behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of God in Jeſus Chriſt, my ſoule is made ſtrong: by <hi>beholding</hi> the <hi>wiſedome</hi> of God in Chriſt, I am made <hi>wiſe;</hi> by <hi>beholding</hi> the <hi>holineſſe</hi> of God in Jeſus Chriſt, I am made <hi>holy.</hi> But now of this humiliation, it is not ſo; by beholding the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53448:51"/> 
                        <hi>holineſſe,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>ſtrength,</hi> or any thing elſe in God, <hi>humiliation</hi> does not riſe by <hi>aſsimulation,</hi> by making me like, but every thing in God daſheth a man, and makes him nothing in his owne eyes. Thus the ſight of God works it.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, I finde in Scripture, that every thing that is in God (if I may ſo ſpeake) is of a <hi>humbling</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2 All that is in God, is of a humbling na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> nature, I find, that God manifeſting any <hi>attribute</hi> of his, at any time, to any of his children, it doth humble them; as for inſtance, let the Lord ſhew his <hi>greatneſſe</hi> (in a ſpirituall way I meane) as he <note place="margin">1 Gods great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> did to <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 8. when he ſaw the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of God, that the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moone</hi> were the workes of Gods <hi>fingers,</hi> then <hi>David</hi> cries out; <hi>VVhat is man Lord, that thou doeſt reſpect him?</hi> It made poore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to be as nothing. So alſo, his <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> his <hi>love,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> as that in <hi>Samuell;</hi> when <hi>David</hi> daunced before the Arke; he cries, <hi>I will be yet more vile,</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath choſen me,</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Michel) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then thy Fathers Houſe.</hi> He <hi>ſaw</hi> the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of God, therefore he would be more <hi>humble,</hi> and more <hi>vile:</hi> And ſo I might ſhew of all the reſt, There is nothing in God, if it be diſcovered to a poore creature that is a ſinner, but it <hi>daſheth</hi> and abaſeth, and <hi>humbleth him;</hi> I will not ſpeake of the Scriptures that poſitively, and punctually prove it; for I ſpake ſomething of them before to you.</p>
                     <p>But if you aske, how can that be, that the <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                        </label> looking upon God ſhould make one humble? how can the beholding of God worke ſuch a <hi>grace</hi> in the heart.</p>
                     <p>Beloved, I have told you a little how it doth <label type="milestone">

                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:53448:51"/> it; and I can tell you no more, and if this will not ſerve; if you cannot ſee clearly how this can be, I muſt referre you to the works of God in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and there you ſhall ſee ſome reſemblance of <note place="margin">Secret works in grace and nature.</note> it, if you can tell me how <hi>Labans</hi> ſheep conceived ſpotted Lambs, by beholding the <hi>peeled rods;</hi> or if you can tell me, how the men were healed of their wounds, by looking on <hi>the brazen Serpent;</hi> then I will tell you how a man by ſeeing of God in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner in Chriſt is humbled.</p>
                     <p>We ſee in nature many ſuch ſtrange myſteries, that we cannot unfold. As they ſay, the <hi>Baſiliske</hi> with her <hi>eye,</hi> will kill a man at a diſtance: and as we ſee here in our owne home, an <hi>onion</hi> will make a man weep at a diſtance.</p>
                     <p>Wee can give ſomething that wee call <hi>reaſon,</hi> but there are a world of things in the creature, as the <hi>ebbing,</hi> and <hi>flowing</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> and the like, that we cannot give a reaſon of. And if it be ſo in the creature; why ſhould it not in this, that a poore ſinner <hi>beholding</hi> God in Chriſt, by faith ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould receive <hi>grace for grace</hi> from him? And if we be poſed in knowing the particular reaſon of the ſtrange operations of God in the work of <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> we might wel ceaſe our diſputes, how <hi>God hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> the ſoule, even by beholding him; when God <hi>beholds</hi> the ſoule, or the ſoule <hi>beholds God.</hi>

                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:53448:52"/>
                     <p>The firſt is this, that I find that it is a generall rule with God towards all creatures: marke it; all <hi>good</hi> is in God; <hi>every good, and perfect gift comes from him;</hi> and I find that it is a generall rule, <note place="margin">God will have all to looke to him in giving.</note> that when God gives any thing to <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Beaſt,</hi> or <hi>Bird,</hi> to <hi>ſoule</hi> or <hi>body,</hi> he will make them <hi>looke</hi> up to him that is the giver. As in <hi>Pſal. 145. 15. The eyes of all</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>wait on thee, and thou giveſt them meat in due ſeaſon; thou openeſt thy hand, and ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the deſire of every living thing.</hi> That is, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that all the creatures, though you know not how it is, yet, God makes the <hi>Birds</hi> and <hi>Beaſts</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, he makes them to <hi>eye,</hi> and to <hi>looke</hi> after him.</p>
                     <p>Another thing is this, the <hi>Lord</hi> will doe this as <note place="margin">God will draw our hearts to him by a fight of him.</note> Chriſt ſaid in another ſence, that he might <hi>draw</hi> mens <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>hearts</hi> to him: juſt as we uſe to do, when we have a mind to bring our children to <hi>love</hi> us, we will have ſome fine thing to give them: we will give it, and the child muſt come to us; there is nothing in the childs comming, to make us give it: but becauſe we will not only beſtow the thing on the child for his good, but <hi>win</hi> his <hi>affections,</hi> and bring him to <hi>know us,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> us, and make a Leg, and to thanke us, and the like: ſo, the Lord will not give any thing to us, but we muſt come and looke to him, that we may not ſo much love the thing, as fall in love with that bleſſed <hi>hand</hi> that gives. Therefore, <hi>our life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Why ſo? that our <hi>affections</hi> may be <hi>above</hi> where Chriſt is, <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 3. 2. So the Lord will not beſtow any thing upon us, but he will have our eye upon him, that we may love, and delight in him that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53448:52"/> beſtowes all upon us. So much briefly for the opening of it.</p>
                     <p>Now I ſhal conclude at this time with a word, or two of uſe, &amp; leave the reſt for another <hi>opportunity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Uſe for the preſent is this, that you may clearely learne hence, that <hi>ſinners,</hi> and <hi>carnall</hi> men, men that are not borne againe, or are not new <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1. Unregenerate men cannot be truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</note> creatures; they cannot be truly <hi>humbled;</hi> they can have no true <hi>humiliation:</hi> becauſe as it is evidently proved in the doctrine before, they have no true <hi>ſight</hi> of God: therefore they cannot be <hi>truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:</hi> they may keep <hi>Faſts,</hi> and come to <hi>church,</hi> and heare <hi>Sermons,</hi> and do a great many things, but they cannot be truly <hi>humbled.</hi> They may have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things like <hi>humiliation,</hi> but it is not true Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell <note place="margin">Yet he may 1 See his ſins.</note> ſaving <hi>humiliation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for inſtance, a wicked carnall man, he may <hi>ſee</hi> his ſins; and he may be <hi>convinced</hi> of them, in a naturallway; juſt for all the world, as a man by the Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> if he have broken any of them if he read the Statutes, by the ſtrength of reaſon, he may ſay I have brok the <hi>Statute.</hi> And ſo he may, by <hi>reading</hi> the book of God, God ſaith that <hi>whormon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, drunkards,</hi> and <hi>coveteous</hi> ſhal <hi>not enter into the Kingdome of God;</hi> and he may ſay, but I am ſuch a one; he may doe this in a <hi>naturall</hi> way; alas this is farre enough from humiliation.</p>
                     <p>Nay farther, the Lord may put wrath in the <note place="margin">2 He may be terrefied.</note> 
                        <hi>Law,</hi> he may put <hi>wrath</hi> in <hi>judgements,</hi> and <hi>afflictions,</hi> and he may be <hi>terrified,</hi> and wofully <hi>troubled</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>ſinne,</hi> and yet not be <hi>humbled:</hi> So the <hi>Devils</hi> in Hell, though they have enough of that, yet they are not <hi>humbled.</hi> So <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> they were <hi>troubled</hi> in this manner, and yet
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53448:53"/> this was not the ſaving <hi>grace,</hi> that the Saints have, and that the Saints only have.</p>
                     <p>Nay farther, he may have many <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3 He may doe acts of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</note> or as it were, that that is like it; he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <hi>humiliation,</hi> he may <hi>hang downe his head as a bulruſh for a day;</hi> he may keepe monethly <hi>Faſts</hi> as conſtantly as any; and be ſorrowfull, and heavy, and yet he hath not true <hi>humiliation.</hi> But as the Prophet ſaith of the Hypocrites, <hi>they hang downe their heads for a day as a bulruſh,</hi> but the Lord ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors them, and their Service. But the likeſt thing that I know to true <hi>humiliation,</hi> is that that wicked men ſhall have at the day judgement: Then I finde that there will be ſomwhat like it; I find then that the wicked man his mouth ſhall be <hi>ſtopped;</hi> he ſhall be ſo farre <hi>humbled,</hi> that he ſhall have no <hi>argument</hi> to plead for himſelfe, he ſhall have no <hi>cloake</hi> for his ſinne: then the <hi>pride</hi> of wicked men will be pulled downe in a great meaſure, in a ſort not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is not true <hi>humiliation:</hi> for, even then, and for ever in <hi>Hell,</hi> the <hi>wicked</hi> will be <hi>grumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> againſt <hi>God;</hi> and a man is not ſaid to be <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> truly, till he <hi>ſubmit</hi> to God in <hi>any</hi> thing: Therefore it is ſaid in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. in hell, <hi>there ſhall be weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> There is gnaſhing of teeth, for <hi>vexation,</hi> and <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</hi> There is no true <hi>humiliation,</hi> or ſhall be in Hell world without end. Nor there is no <hi>carnall</hi> man upon earth that is truly <hi>humbled.</hi>
                     </p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53448:54"/> God came into the hearts of his <hi>Saints</hi> by it; how gloriouſly did the Lord <hi>appeare in them?</hi> and <hi>raviſh</hi> their ſoules, that their hearts are yet <hi>nearer</hi> to God, and they walke more <hi>humbly,</hi> and <hi>cloſely,</hi> and <hi>thankfully.</hi> But we ſee the gang of the world, <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and all <hi>carnal</hi> people are more <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>wicked,</hi> and <hi>carnall,</hi> and ready to <hi>beat their Fellow Servants;</hi> they are <hi>worſe,</hi> and <hi>worſe,</hi> and no <hi>wonder,</hi> becauſe God hath not <hi>diſcovered</hi> himſelf in theſe mercies, they will not learne.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now to open theſe to you. I ſay that every Saint that is truly <hi>humbled.</hi> By <hi>humiliation</hi> I told
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53448:56"/> you, I meane not a <hi>preparatorie humiliation,</hi> as ſome <note place="margin">In our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> of our Divines ſay; or an <hi>after</hi> humiliation: but the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>humiliation</hi> that is alway in every Saint, and that <hi>grows</hi> more and more as other graces; as <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> and the like; now to know whether you be thus humbled.</p>
                     <p>The firſt queſtion will be, whether ever God hath brought thee to <hi>ſubmit,</hi> to the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <note place="margin">1. By ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the righteouſnes of Chriſt.</note> 
                        <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for <hi>juſtification?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That is the firſt, and the chiefeſt thing, as it is in <hi>Rom. 10. 3. They being ignorant of Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſnes, they have not ſubmitted to the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> Now whether hath the Lord ever brought thee to a full <hi>deſpaire,</hi> of ever being juſtified in the <hi>ſight</hi> of God, or of getting any <hi>favor</hi> from him, or of <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> by any <hi>good</hi> that is in thee, or hath been done by thee; or any hope that thou ſhalt have any good or doe <hi>any good.</hi> I ſay that if thou be <hi>truly humbled,</hi> thou art brought to that. And I ſay, this is the firſt, and chiefeſt thing. Becauſe that a man is more <hi>prone</hi> to his own <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> (ſuch as it is) then to his <hi>ſin,</hi> &amp; a man ſticks cloſer to his <hi>owne</hi> righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes then to his <hi>ſin,</hi> for it is an eaſier thing to bring twenty men from their ſins, then one man from his <hi>righteouſneſſe.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Why man is naturally prone to cleave to his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. <hi>Simile.</hi>
                        </note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ground is this: becauſe it is that liquor, that was firſt put into us; the liquor that is put into a veſſell firſt, that ſticks <hi>longer,</hi> and hath a <hi>deeper</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and keeps the taſt longer, if it be <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> or <hi>VVine,</hi> or any thing that is put in a new barrell.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>God</hi> made us firſt <hi>righteous;</hi> afterwards we <hi>ſought out many inventions,</hi> after we fell: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53448:57"/> it is more naturall to us, to be <hi>righteous</hi> in ſome faſhion, with ſome faſhioned righteouſneſſe ſuch as it is, then to be <hi>ſinfull.</hi> And a man ſticks cloſer to his <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and is more troubled with it, and more <hi>endangered by it</hi> a thouſand fold, then by his ſinns. For <hi>truly,</hi> ſinne is nothing but a <hi>feaveriſh</hi> diſtemper in a man, he is many times <note place="margin">Sin what.</note> 
                        <hi>drawn</hi> to <hi>drunkenneſſe,</hi> and to <hi>whoredome:</hi> but take a carnall man, when he is beſt his owne man, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooves <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> better then <hi>ſinne:</hi> ſo that we may ſee, it is righteouſneſſe he aimes at, and he will commend a Preacher that would have him leave ſinne, rather then one that will help him on in it: ſo that its a principle more rooted in mans heart to be <hi>righteous,</hi> then to be <hi>ſinfull:</hi> but it is not the <hi>righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> remember that; it is but that a man would get up; he would <hi>repaire</hi> that ſhattered, and <hi>torne righteouſneſſe,</hi> that once was in him by <hi>Adam,</hi> that a man is more prone to: though by ſinne, by a feaveriſh diſtemper, he is oft carried from that; but none are ſo farre carried, but he followes it in ſome meaſure, and in a great meaſure.</p>
                     <p>Now the queſtion is, whether the Lord hath <hi>wholly</hi> brought thee from that <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> to <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">To be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the righteouſnes of another.</note> 
                        <hi>wholly</hi> to the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>another.</hi> That is the firſt expreſſion, whereby I ſhall demonſtrate it; <hi>Whether a man be brought wholly from his owne righteouſneſſe, to ſubmit wholly to the righteouſneſſe of another;</hi> that is, to the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> now in Heaven. If thou art come to this, then thou art an humbled man. For, it is a great point of <hi>humilitie</hi> for at man to <hi>ſtoop</hi> to another; ro be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53448:57"/> 
                        <hi>beholding</hi> to <hi>another</hi> for a thing, when he thinks that he hath one that is good of his <hi>owne:</hi> Now for me to leave my <hi>owne</hi> righteouſneſſe, and to goe and ſeeke a righteouſneſſe <hi>only in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>walke</hi> in that all the dayes of my life, and to <hi>live</hi> upon that righteouſneſſe, this ſhews that a man hath a <hi>humble</hi> heart; let the world ſay what it will, here is the maine point of <hi>humiliation</hi> in this world. It is not <hi>whining,</hi> and <hi>crying,</hi> and <hi>howling,</hi> wicked men, and proud men may doe this, and be <hi>roaring,</hi> and <hi>damning</hi> themſelves, and the like, the <hi>Devill</hi> may doe ſo, that hath no true <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here is true <hi>humiliation,</hi> for a man to <hi>deny</hi> his owne <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and to embrace <hi>humbly</hi> the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> that is in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> I ſay to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>wholly,</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> with it.</p>
                     <p>That as one godlie man ſaith, <hi>God</hi> at the firſt put a great <hi>ſtock</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> in <hi>Adams</hi> hand to <note place="margin">Simile.</note> trade with; he made him a <hi>righteous</hi> man, and when <hi>Adam</hi> fell, <hi>God</hi> tooke away his <hi>ſtock,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> ſaid he ſhould never <hi>trade,</hi> and ſet up <hi>ſhop</hi> more. <hi>God</hi> had a way indeed to doe him good, but he ſhould never ſet up ſhop againe. We would <hi>ſet</hi> up ſhop, and <hi>trade</hi> as <hi>Adam did:</hi> there is no man in the world though his <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> be never ſo little, but he would rather goe with that <hi>portion,</hi> of a <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of his <hi>owne,</hi> then ſubmit to the <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> righteouſneſſe of the <hi>Lord Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore I ſay, this is it, whether the Lord hath brought thy <hi>Spirit</hi> to be <hi>humble,</hi> that thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be a foole while thou liveſt, and to let <hi>Chriſt</hi> be <hi>wiſedome</hi> in thee; that thou wouldeſt be a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53448:58"/> 
                        <hi>poore</hi> infirme <hi>fraile</hi> creature, and let Chriſt Jeſus be thy <hi>righteouſneſſe;</hi> that thou art content to walke in <hi>raggs,</hi> and let Chriſt be thy <hi>riches.</hi> This is one thing.</p>
                     <p>In that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. It was the <hi>pride</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> that kept them from ſalvation by the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> of the Goſpell; <hi>they would not ſubmit to the righteouſneſſe of God;</hi> they were a proud people. So that is it that keeps many a ſoule that hears the word; it is that that keepes you <hi>weake,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What it is that keepes men in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble.</note> and full of <hi>woe,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow</hi> all your dayes. You thinke it is the want of <hi>this</hi> grace, and the want of <hi>that</hi> grace, and other things; but it is nothing but your owne <hi>ſtubborne</hi> heart, that you will not <hi>ſubmit</hi> to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt: You would have <hi>this</hi> grace, and <hi>that</hi> grace; that is, you would fill up every corner of your <hi>owne</hi> ſhop, and you would <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend</hi> your <hi>owne trading,</hi> but you would not <hi>ſhut</hi> up <hi>ſhop,</hi> and be journey-men (as I may ſpeake with reverence) to Jeſus Chriſt. That is one thing.</p>
                     <p>Then againe, the ſecond particular I have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate; <note place="margin">2. To take the righteouſnes of Chriſt on his bare word.</note> that whether you be humbled or no, is this, whether the Lord have brought you to be content to take the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt upon his owne <hi>bare,</hi> and <hi>naked word?</hi> Whether now you can ſay, there is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> full of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> for me, and my <hi>own</hi> righteouſneſſe is full of <hi>raggs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What <hi>evidence</hi> have you for it?</p>
                     <p>Here is a <hi>word,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is come to dye for <hi>ſinners,</hi> I find nothing in me, but here is a <hi>bare word;</hi> and hereupon I am content to take his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,

                     </p>
                     <p>But the queſtion is in matter of <hi>believing,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould not throw away my owne <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and <hi>wholly</hi> believe in Jeſus Chriſts <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> before I ſee any grace; or any ſigne?</p>
                     <p>A <hi>humble heart</hi> can doe it, and is content that marks ſhould come after he believes; after I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God will ſanctifie me, and worke <hi>grace,</hi> and then I ſhall ſee his <hi>love</hi> more. But the firſt bargain betweene God, and me, is his <hi>bare</hi> word: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. is glorious, and cleare, and comfortable. The Apoſtle lays downe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene <hi>ſalvation</hi> by the <hi>Law,</hi> and by <hi>faith;</hi> ſaith he, the <hi>Righteouſneſſe of the Law, ſpeaketh on this wiſe. The man that doth theſe things, ſhall live by them: but the righteouſneſſe which is of Faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe; ſay not in thy heart, who ſhall aſcend into Heaven, or who ſhall deſcend into the Deepe; but he that believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Marke it, this is the ſtraine, and <hi>ſtreame,</hi> and <hi>language</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell;</hi> that is, <hi>ſalvation</hi> by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>whoſoever</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on that ſalvation, ſhall not be <hi>aſhamed;</hi> he ſhall be ſure of it.</p>
                     <p>But how ſhall we come to believe, and to be ſure of this ſalvation? <hi>Say not in thy heart, who ſhall goe up to heaven, or who ſhall deſcend into the deep: but what ſaith it? the word is nigh thee;</hi> that is God hath given a <hi>word,</hi> and he will give a <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>faith</hi>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:53448:59"/> with it; and there are but <hi>two</hi> words to the <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,</hi> there is the <hi>ſpirit</hi> in thee, and the <hi>word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee:</hi> and this is the <hi>righteouſneſſe of God;</hi> the righteouſneſſe of <hi>faith</hi> ſaith ſo. <hi>Say not who ſhall goe up to heaven, or downe to the earth:</hi> For, the eyes of a fool are ſcattered about the world. And when men come to believe in Chriſt, they aske, <hi>who ſhall aſcend into Heaven?</hi> how ſhall I come to know that I am a <hi>Saint,</hi> and that I am <hi>predeſtinated?</hi> The Lord would have us believe the word, that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus came to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chiefe.</hi> Here is a word, if the heart now could apply this by the ſpirit of <hi>faith.</hi> That is another thing, I would have you thinke on.</p>
                     <p>Your ordinary <hi>Profeſſors</hi> moſt of them, they <note place="margin">Why ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profeſſors want aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> have not <hi>aſſurance</hi> of ſalvation, why? They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>believe.</hi> Why ſo? becauſe they finde ſo many <hi>corruptions</hi> in them, and they finde ſo many <hi>graces</hi> wanting, and they have ill <hi>memories,</hi> and <hi>hard</hi> hearts, and if it were not for theſe things, they could <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> What is the meaning of it? It is as if they ſhould ſay, I will never <hi>truſt</hi> God in the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> upon his <hi>bare</hi> word.</p>
                     <p>God will have us truſt him, ere he will truſt us; we muſt take God upon his word, God wil bring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very child of his to this, to take his <hi>ſalvation</hi> upon a <hi>bare</hi> word, and he will bleſſe his name for it; I have but <hi>one</hi> ſoule, and if I had a <hi>thouſand,</hi> I would venture them all upon his <hi>word,</hi> and ſay there my ſoule lyes, <hi>ſinck,</hi> or <hi>ſwim,</hi> or goe to <hi>heaven,</hi> or <hi>hell,</hi> here is the <hi>word,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chiefe.</hi> Now, if there be <hi>pride</hi> in the heart, it will not come, and reſt on a <hi>bare word.</hi> The
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53448:59"/> Lord make you underſtand theſe things that they may not be loſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, a humble heart, will be content not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">3. With a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall word.</note> with a <hi>bare</hi> word, but with the <hi>leaſt</hi> word, and the moſt <hi>generall</hi> word.</p>
                     <p>A proud heart will not be content unleſſe he hath a <hi>perticular</hi> word. For my part, I may miſtake, but I will tell you my opinion; that thoſe men (how <note place="margin">Chriſt dyed not for all.</note> ever otherwiſe they be godly, ſome of them) that doe hold that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did <hi>dye</hi> for <hi>all men,</hi> and that he came to ſave <hi>Judas,</hi> as well as <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If Chriſt came to ſave <hi>all,</hi> and yet <hi>many</hi> ſhall goe to <hi>Hell,</hi> how come they to be <hi>ſaved?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a proud thought in the heart that would <hi>teach God</hi> how to <hi>ſpeake,</hi> and how to make <hi>promiſes,</hi> and we poore wretched, damnable creatures, muſt ſhew him what <hi>language</hi> he ſhall ſpeake in: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now, a <hi>humble</hi> heart will take the <hi>leaſt,</hi> and moſt <hi>generall</hi> word, and <hi>thanke</hi> God: as we ſee in the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Chriſt gives her never a <hi>word</hi> a great while, but <hi>frownes;</hi> and then he gives her a <hi>terrible</hi> word, and bids her goe, he calls her <hi>Dogg;</hi> why, that was ſomething; a <hi>Dogg</hi> hath ſome <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge;</hi> he hath the <hi>crums that fall from the Table,</hi> he looks for outward mercies; and therefore in that he calls me <hi>Dogg,</hi> I have ſo much of that <hi>word</hi> that I will follow him for the <hi>crums.</hi> Saith Chriſt to her, <hi>O Woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee as thou wilt.</hi> So <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants, when they came with <hi>Halters</hi> about their necks: ſaith the King, <hi>Is my brother Benhadad alive?</hi> that was a comfortable word, they harpt upon, and catcht at that; <hi>Thy brother Benhadad is alive:</hi> So, we come with <hi>Ropes</hi>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:53448:60"/> about our necks, poore damned <hi>creatures,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> comes in infinite wiſedome, and makes <hi>promiſes,</hi> and a humble heart will take them, and bleſſe God for any promiſe, be it never ſo <hi>generall,</hi> and not ſtand ſo nicely, as proud people doe. This ſhews a <hi>humble</hi> heart; therefore examine if this be ſo with thee.</p>
                     <p>Fourthlie, a <hi>humble</hi> heart in matter of <hi>juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> it appeares by this; that as it is content to have a <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> in <hi>another.</hi>

                     <p>And thirdly, he will take the moſt generall word.</p>
                     <p>So fourthly, he will wholly <hi>renounce,</hi> and throw away his owne <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and as <hi>Paul</hi> did, call it <hi>du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>There are many men that goe a great way in the <hi>pofeſsion</hi> of religion; but being pretty honeſt, <hi>civil</hi> men before, they will never be brought to <hi>renounce</hi> their owne <hi>righteouſneſſe.</hi> Now Jeſus Chriſt will never <hi>mend</hi> the heart by <hi>patching</hi> it, but either he will make it <hi>wholly</hi> new, or the <hi>Devill</hi> ſhall have all; he will have the heart to have his <hi>righteouſneſſe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or none at all: now a man muſt <hi>throw</hi> away all, there muſt be nothing kept, as in the practiſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> there muſt be no <hi>buts:</hi> for men to ſay <hi>but</hi> we
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53448:60"/> have <hi>ſome</hi> good things; and it is great pitty to <hi>throw</hi> away all, What, <hi>all</hi> my <hi>prayers,</hi> and all my <hi>humiliations,</hi> and all my <hi>faſtings?</hi> all good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to make dung, and dogs meat? I, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks as if his <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> had been a <hi>chaine,</hi> and a <hi>burthen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, a <hi>humble</hi> heart, a <hi>humble</hi> man, or woman <note place="margin">5.

                     </p>
                     <p>There is a great deale of pride in mens hearts, they will not <hi>receive</hi> grace, and ſalvation of God, becauſe of the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of their <hi>ſins.</hi> There is no man that talks of the <hi>greatneſſe of his ſinns,</hi> with a ſpirit of unbeliefe, but it proceeds from <hi>pride.</hi> When a man talks of his <hi>great</hi> ſinns, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is <hi>afraid</hi> to <hi>believe;</hi> that is from <hi>pride:</hi> for the greater a mans ſins are, the ſooner he would <hi>believe,</hi> if he had a <hi>humble</hi> heart. <hi>Depart from me Lord</hi> (ſaith Peter) <hi>for I am a ſinfull man.</hi> He had more need to have ſaid <hi>come</hi> to me Lord, for I am a <hi>ſinfull</hi> man.</p>
                     <p>And then if his <hi>preparations</hi> be never ſo little.

There muſt be no <hi>ſtay</hi> for want of <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> when the Lord <hi>calls;</hi> when the Lord <hi>offers</hi> Chriſt, well, that is one thing that you may trye your <hi>humiliation</hi> by; your carriage towards God, in reſpect of his juſtifying grace, or the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt that <hi>juſtifies,</hi> or Gods righteouſnes

                     <p>The ſecond thing is this, you may trie if your <note place="margin">2 By our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to God in his truths revealed.</note> hearts be <hi>humbled;</hi> if you conſider your carriage towards <hi>God,</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>will,</hi> or in reſpect of his <hi>truths,</hi> that he manifeſts to you, from time to time.

The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall minde is enmity againſt God, for, it is not ſubject to the law of God, nor can be.</hi> A carnall mind, is <hi>enmity</hi> againſt God; It is not only an <hi>enemy,</hi> but <hi>enmity</hi> it ſelfe. And he doth not only ſay it <hi>will not,</hi> but it <hi>cannot</hi> be ſubject to the Law, that is, to the <hi>will</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>Beloved a <hi>proud</hi> heart, or a heart that is not <note place="margin">Proud carnall men.</note> 
                        <hi>humbled,</hi> it will not ſubmit to the <hi>Truth</hi> of God: but, it will alway doe one of theſe three things.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is this; he is not <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>know all</hi> the <note place="margin">1. Are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to know all the truths of God.</note> 
                        <hi>truths</hi> of God: he is not willing to <hi>know</hi> them: for hee knowes if hee doe <hi>know</hi> them, hee muſt <hi>doe</hi> them.

                     <p>But here is the queſtion, whether thou be <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> to <hi>know</hi> the will of <hi>God?</hi>

                     <p>Now is there in you ſuch a heart, that though <note place="margin">Saints willing to know all Gods truths.</note> you <hi>know</hi> that you ſhall be ſaved, and goe to <hi>Heae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> (as an honeſt man once ſaid) yet have you a <hi>deſire</hi> to <hi>know every</hi> truth, though you ſuffer never ſo much <hi>perſecution</hi> for it?

                     <p>As for inſtance, ſuppoſe a truth ſhould come upon one of your ſoules, that thou that art a <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,</hi>

And ſo put it on another; it may be this truth comes into his ſoule, that every man that lives in any <hi>knowne</hi> ſinne ſhall be caſt out of the Kingdome of God, and of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor. 6.

He hopes God hath given him <hi>repentance,</hi> and he goes <hi>on</hi> in <hi>ſinne;</hi> then God comes, and tells him, that if he had <hi>repented,</hi> he would <hi>leave</hi> his ſinns, and amend his courſe, then ſaith he, I hope I ſhall repent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, I ſhall <hi>repent</hi> ſometime, or other, though I do not now.</p>
                     <p>If God tell him againe, the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>ſalvation</hi> will be paſt, and the <hi>doore will be ſhut,</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> will come too late: then he ſhifts it off, and ſaith, I hope I doe repent with all my heart, and with all my ſoule.</p>
                     <p>But if God ſay, if you did repent, then you would <hi>leave</hi> all your ſins. He will ſay, good Lord, is there any man in the world without ſinne? and ſo it is endleſſe the <hi>ſhifts,</hi> and <hi>tricks,</hi> and <hi>quillets</hi> whereby a man, when he is Arreſted by the

                        <hi>truth</hi> all his life, would <hi>avoyd</hi> the edge, and <hi>power</hi> of the truth.</p>
                     <p>Now let us come to our owne ſoules, you, and I, and ſee how it is with us, in reſpect of all the bleſſed <hi>truths</hi> of God that are in this booke.</p>
                     <p>Are you willing, and deſirous to know them, though they bring <hi>perſecution?</hi> And when a truth hath come, that hath been croſſe to you, have you not taken <hi>Armes</hi> againſt it, or contended with it; as the Scripture ſpeaks of thoſe that <hi>obey not the truth,</hi> but ſtrive againſt it.

                     <p>There is no <hi>Drunkard,</hi> nor <hi>Swearer,</hi> but he knows that if he live in that ſinne, he ſhall be damned; and he cannot deny but that he is a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> or a <hi>Swearer,</hi> or it may be a <hi>Whoremonger,</hi> and yet you may talke with him two, or three houres, and he will goe from this to that, and he <hi>hopes</hi> this, and that, and you ſhall never have him let the edge of truth come to him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, and ſo I have done. I have ſhewed you how you may know you are <hi>humbled,</hi> by your carriage, and <hi>deportment</hi> of your ſoules in reſpect of Gods <hi>juſtifying</hi> grace.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, how to conſider of your conſtant temper, and carriage of your ſoules to the <hi>truths</hi> of God, to the <hi>will</hi> of God <hi>revealed</hi> to you, <note place="margin">3. By our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to Gods commands.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now thirdly, conſider the carriage of your ſouls, in reſpect of the injunctions, or <hi>commands</hi> of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53448:64"/> God that are layd upon you; the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a heart truly <hi>humbled</hi> by <hi>ſeeing</hi> of God in Jeſus Chriſt is this: to be <hi>willing</hi> to obey God in <hi>any</hi> thing that God layes upon him, juſt as we ſee it was with <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9. When he was humbled by ſeeing of God, he cryes out, ſaith he, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to doe?</hi> As if he had ſayd, I could have indented with thee formerly, whether I ſhould doe <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that;</hi> and I would doe <hi>what</hi> I pleaſe, and <hi>when</hi> I pleaſed; but now Lord, <hi>What wilt thou have me to doe?</hi> Whatſoever it is, it ſhall be all one, only ſhew me what it is, and I will <hi>obey</hi> it. And then he bids him goe, and have his <hi>eyes</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and then he muſt <hi>Preach,</hi> and then he muſt be <hi>Perſecuted,</hi> and then he muſt goe into a <hi>Ship,</hi> and be carried a <hi>Priſoner</hi> a great way by ſea; and there Souldiers were like to <hi>kill</hi> him; and then the ſhip muſt be <hi>ſplit,</hi> and yet <hi>Paul</hi> was content. <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to doe?</hi> he followed God in every thing; ſo in <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 10. 11. When <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did come and teach the will of God; the people they cried, <hi>What ſhall we doe?</hi> and the Publicans, <hi>VVhat ſhall we doe?</hi> and the Souldiers, <hi>and what ſhall we doe?</hi> This is the diſpoſition of a heart that is humbled, he deſires to know what the <hi>will,</hi> and what the <hi>command</hi> of God is, and he yeilds <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to it.</p>
                     <p>Now on the other ſide, it is not ſo with carnall <note place="margin">Proud hearts diſobey Gods commands.</note> 
                        <hi>proud</hi> people; they are like thoſe in <hi>Pſal. 12. 4. Our tongues are our owne we ought to ſpeake, what Lord ſhall controll us?</hi> We will <hi>ſpeake</hi> what we liſt, and <hi>doe</hi> what we <hi>pleaſe;</hi> we will goe our owne wayes, and doe that which is right in our owne eyes. As
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53448:65"/> they ſay in <hi>Jer. 2, 31. We are Lords, and we will come no more unto thee;</hi> We are Lords, and we will goe our owne wayes. Beloved: every <hi>carnall</hi> man in the World though he think there is a <hi>God;</hi> yet he thinks he was borne, and brought into the World to doe his <hi>owne</hi> will, and to pleaſe <hi>himſelfe:</hi> therefore as far as the <hi>will</hi> of God ſuits to that, he will doe it: but otherwiſe that is the maine ſtreame of his life to doe his owne <hi>will.</hi> Now as I told you in the former, ſo in this, there are three tempers in the heart of a <hi>carnall</hi> man, concerning Gods commands, that are contrary to the temper, and poſture of a <hi>gratious</hi> heart that is truely <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt thing that we finde in the word, and by <note place="margin">1. A proud heart ſoone weary of Gods commands.</note> experience, is. That when the Lord lays a <hi>command</hi> upon a man that is not truely <hi>humbled,</hi> it may be he doth not reſiſt preſently, but he will be ſoon wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and <hi>tyred,</hi> and that is a baſe thing, he will be <hi>jaded</hi> under it; It may be at the firſt he will not <hi>fight</hi> againſt it, as ſome do, but he wil ſoon be <hi>jaded,</hi> he will ſoon be <hi>tired.</hi> There is many a man, and many a woman, that have taken <hi>pleaſure</hi> in the <hi>will</hi> of God, and in the <hi>commands</hi> of God in <hi>former</hi> time, and have gloryed, and rejoyced in it: but <hi>now</hi> they begin to be <hi>wearie,</hi> and to be <hi>jaded</hi> like <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> horſes, they are paſt their beſt, they have no heart to it. I feare it is ſo with too many of you. Like the people in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. The Lord bids them to offer ſacrifice, and they ſay, <hi>Behold what a wearineſſe it is, and they ſnuffed at it, and they brought that which was torne;</hi> and <hi>lame,</hi> and <hi>ſick.</hi> So you need not wonder that God hath a quarrell with
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53448:65"/> you when you ſay, <hi>what a wearineſſe is it</hi> to ſerve him; what a <hi>wearineſſe,</hi> and <hi>tedious</hi> thing it is to <hi>hear</hi> the Preacher thus <hi>all</hi> day long: and to be <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>hearing</hi> all the <hi>week;</hi> what an endleſſe thing it is to begin again to <hi>morrow,</hi> and <hi>next</hi> day, and <hi>every</hi> day: and you ſnuffe at it, and you are ready to loath it. This is the diſpoſition of a heart that God hath not truely <hi>humbled,</hi> that hath never <hi>ſeen</hi> the face of God in Jeſus Chriſt. Looke in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. The people that God layd thoſe ſpirituall judgements upon, to give them up to all <hi>unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> to <hi>commit filthineſſe man with man;</hi> what was the reaſon of all this? One was, becauſe when they <hi>knew God, they did not glorifie him as God:</hi> they had ſome knowledge, but they did not improve it. Another was, they did <hi>reſiſt</hi> the truth, they did levie <hi>forces</hi> againſt it: and they <hi>liked</hi> not to <hi>retaine the knowledge of God.</hi> They had a little <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, and that <hi>galled</hi> them, becauſe their practice was contrary, therefore they <hi>liked</hi> not to retaine that knowledge; they had no <hi>liking</hi> to keep that little <hi>knowledge</hi> of God; they wiſhed as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſayth, every wicked man in the World wiſheth that he were wholly <hi>Ignorant</hi> of God, for his knowledge doth but onely <hi>imhitter</hi> him, and <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> him in his way. That is the firſt thing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He is not onely <hi>wearie</hi> of it, and if he <note place="margin">2. He layes vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands on Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> can he will be rid of it ſo: but he will lay <hi>violent</hi> hands upon the <hi>commands</hi> of God. There is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible word in <hi>Rom. 1. 18. The wrath of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven, againſt thoſe that hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> The word in the Greek is, thoſe that <hi>Impriſon</hi> the truth: There was <hi>truth</hi>
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:53448:66"/> came to them, and they held it till they were <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> till they were <hi>tyred,</hi> and <hi>jaded:</hi> but then they <hi>locked</hi> it up, and would not ſuffer it to <hi>break</hi> forth in their lives, but lived as if there were no <hi>light</hi> at all in them. There is ſome kind of <hi>light</hi> in them, but it is in <hi>Priſon,</hi> you cannot ſee it, and you would think there were <hi>none</hi> at all, like thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 19. When God had ſaid they ſhould have <hi>no King</hi> but him: but ſay they, <hi>we will have a King,</hi> and ſo they goe <hi>violently,</hi> and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately againſt the <hi>command</hi> of God. Thus is it with a carnall proud heart.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, it may be ſome men will <note place="margin">3. Proud hearts obey Gods commands, but upon their owne tearmes.</note> not doe ſo with the commands of God, but they will <hi>obey</hi> them, but it ſhall be onely upon their owne termes; they were as good doe nothing.</p>
                     <p>As for inſtance, he will obey, firſt by <hi>ſits,</hi> and <note place="margin">1. When they pleaſe.</note> when he is at <hi>leaſure.</hi> As it may be, you have ſeen a <hi>proud</hi> ſervant that will worke well <hi>ſometimes;</hi> but he is ſo <hi>ſturdie</hi> that he will doe nothing but what he <hi>pleaſeth:</hi> and if the humour take him he will goe to the <hi>Shop,</hi> or elſe it may be he will <hi>Walk</hi> at his pleaſure two or three dayes together; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not build on it. So carnall <hi>unhumbled</hi> hearts, when they are in the <hi>humour</hi> they will <hi>obey</hi> the <hi>commands</hi> of God; but it is but for a fit. Now a right Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, is <hi>holy alway,</hi> according to the grace God hath given him, he is <hi>alway</hi> ready to obey the <hi>commands</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a proud <hi>unhumbled</hi> heart, as he will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey <note place="margin">2. What they pleaſe.</note> but at <hi>ſometimes;</hi> ſo he will obey but in <hi>ſome things;</hi> he will <hi>pick</hi> and <hi>chooſe</hi> in the <hi>commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>ſervice</hi> of God, what he <hi>pleaſeth.</hi> That
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53448:66"/> is the manner of <hi>proud</hi> Servants, they will worke ſometimes, but if a man bid them doe <hi>one</hi> thing, they will doe <hi>another,</hi> a man were as good be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. Such a <hi>Servant</hi> will be <hi>wiſer</hi> in his owne eyes then his <hi>Maſter.</hi> It may be he will doe his Maſters work, and his Maſter cannot ſay but that he is a <hi>diligent</hi> ſervant, but he will doe but what he liſts, and he will doe it but in his <hi>owne</hi> way; and if his Maſter bid him doe <hi>one</hi> thing he will doe <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> So it is with a <hi>carnall</hi> man, when God bids him doe any thing, he will doe <hi>ſomewhat,</hi> and let his <hi>Neighbours</hi> doe the reſt if they will. But now an <hi>honeſt</hi> heart, <hi>whatſoever</hi> God <hi>commands,</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to this or that, be it what it will be, if the Lord <hi>command</hi> it, he will <hi>endeavour</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, as they will <hi>obey</hi> God at <note place="margin">3. When God gives them rewards.</note> their owne <hi>leaſure,</hi> and obey him in thoſe things that they <hi>pleaſe:</hi> ſo they will doe it if God follow them with a reward. As for inſtance. You may obſerve many a <hi>proud</hi> hearted man, <hi>Miniſter,</hi> or others, as long as God hath given them <hi>credit</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and <hi>riches</hi> enough, they will doe the <hi>worke</hi> of God bravely: but take away that, and they will doe nothing at all. Therefore if God will let <hi>credit,</hi> and <hi>riches</hi> goe alwayes with <hi>Religion,</hi> he ſhal have <hi>Servants</hi> enough, and <hi>proud</hi> ones too. But now a <hi>humble</hi> Chriſtian he values the <hi>love</hi> of God, more then the things themſelves; and let <hi>theſe</hi> things come or goe, his <hi>eye</hi> is upon God, and his <hi>love</hi> is ſuch to God, and he ſees that God <hi>loves</hi> him ſo, that he will endeavour to obey God <hi>in all</hi> things, whether he be <hi>rewarded</hi> or no. Now theſe be the diſpoſitions of <hi>carnall unhumbled</hi> hearts;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53448:67"/> you may examine your owne hearts by theſe three things. By your carriage towards God in reſpect of his <hi>juſtifying</hi> grace; By your carriage towards God in reſpect of his <hi>truths</hi> revealed to you; And be your carriage towards God in reſpect of his <hi>injunctions,</hi> and <hi>commands</hi> that he layes on you. If you examine, and finde that your hearts are not <hi>humbled,</hi> you know what to doe, deſire God to <hi>ſhew</hi> himſelfe more, and as you <hi>ſee</hi> him more, ſo you will be <hi>humbled</hi> more; for the right <hi>ſeeing</hi> of God in Jeſus Chriſt is the true and ready way to humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</p>

I ſay thou mayeſt know whether thy ſoule be a <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi>
                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:53448:68"/> ſoule by thy carriage in ſuch times as theſe are. It hath been a common rule among the godly that as a man is in <hi>afflictions,</hi> ſo he is <hi>indeed.</hi> Truely that rule hath much truth in it, though it be not alwayes true: for a man may looſe himſelfe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in afflictions more then in another conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As <hi>Jonah,</hi> he was a godly man, yet very unlike himſelfe when God corrected him, and had taken away his Gourd: but ordinarily, ſuch as the man is, ſo he will be in <hi>affliction.</hi> The Lord in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> compares affliction to a boyling, ſeething pot, you know if you put meat into a pot, and though it be not ſo cleane waſhed, if you put no <hi>fire</hi> under it, the water will be cleare: but if you put <hi>fire</hi> under, then you ſhall ſee the ſcum and <note place="margin">Afflictions as fire.</note> filth come up. Afflictions are called Gods <hi>fire,</hi> becauſe uſually the ſcum and the droſs that is in us which otherwiſe lies hid, is then ſeen: and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are called trialls; they trie what is in us. And truely of all corruptions there is none, there is no froth in the ſoule of man that will appeare ſooner, or more in <hi>afflictions,</hi> then the pride of his ſoule, the <hi>loftineſſe</hi> of his ſoule. This was the reaſon why Satan would have God to give him leave to <note place="margin">Why Satan deſired to tempt <hi>Job.</hi>
                        </note> tempt Job: becauſe I know ſayth he, that Job is a devout man, but he <hi>Serves not God for nought.</hi> I warrant you if you put him in the <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>affliction</hi> you ſhall ſee a great deale of droſſe in Job; he will <hi>ſtorme,</hi> and <hi>rage,</hi> and <hi>fume,</hi> you would quickly ſee the pride of his heart. Saith God thou ſhalt have him, doe what thou wilt with him, <hi>trie</hi> him if he be ſo: and doubtleſſe though it be ſaid a good while, <hi>In all this Job ſinned not,</hi> yet Job ſinned before
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53448:69"/> the end: and there is a great deale of Jobs <hi>pride</hi> to be ſeen from the beginning of the Book to the end. Well then I ſay in <hi>afflictions</hi> thou mayeſt know thy owne, and I mine. Therefore let us not ſpeake of things we know not, but ſpeake of our <hi>owne</hi> afflictions, the afflictions and corrections that <hi>thou</hi> art wont to fall into, and that are <hi>thine,</hi> whether it be <hi>ſickneſſe,</hi> or weakneſſe, or a bad <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> or a wanton <hi>Wife,</hi> or an ill <hi>Neighbour,</hi> thou knoweſt them beſt; now by thy carriage under thoſe, thou ſhalt finde how far God hath beſtowed on thee this grace of humiliation.</p>

We ſee thoſe that corrected the Saints there, the King of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiria,</hi> he is ſaid to be the <hi>Axe</hi> in Gods hand; he is ſaid to be the <hi>rod,</hi> and the <hi>ſtaffe,</hi> and the <hi>Axe,</hi> An <hi>Axe</hi> cannot <hi>cut</hi> without ſome hew with it, and a <hi>ſtaffe</hi> cannot <hi>beat</hi> without ſome hold it; and a <hi>rod</hi>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:53448:69"/> cannot <hi>whip</hi> unleſſe ſome take it in their hand. A <hi>humble</hi> heart, let the <hi>affliction</hi> be what it will, and the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> be what it will; it ſees all as a <hi>rod,</hi> or as a <hi>ſtaffe</hi> that is a little heavier, or as an <hi>Axe</hi> that is heavier, and ſorer then that; but all in the <hi>hand</hi> of God. I will give you a common knowne inſtance, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 5. There was a man whoſe name was <hi>Shimei</hi> he comes againſt <hi>David</hi> and caſts ſtones at him, and <hi>Shimei curſed David, and ſaid come out, come out thou bloudy man of Beliall. Tu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vir Belial, Thou ſon of Belial.</hi> The proper deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a wicked man, a man that doth not grow in goodneſſe: it is ordinarily read, thou ſon of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall.</hi> This man curſed David in Verſ. 9. <hi>Then ſaid Abiſhai the ſon of Zerviah unto the King, why ſhould this dead dog curſe my Lord the King? Let me goe over I pray thee,</hi> and take off his head. He beeing of a <hi>proud</hi> ſpirit, calls him <hi>dog;</hi> and did not ſee God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the tongue of <hi>Shimei.</hi> But what ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid? What have I to doe with you ye ſons of Zerviah? ſo let him curſe, becauſe the Lord hath ſaid unto him curſe David, who ſhall then ſay wherefore haſt thou done ſo?</hi> It had been an eaſie thing for a <hi>King</hi> to take off the head of a <hi>ſingle</hi> man that curſed him: but he reaſoned with himſelfe and ſaw that the Lord had commanded <hi>Shimei</hi> to curſe <hi>David,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith he, why ſhould I meddle with him? <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> calls him <hi>bloudy</hi> man, becauſe he had taken the Kingdome, and ſucceeded <hi>Saul:</hi> but <hi>David</hi> calls to minde the bloud of <hi>Uriah,</hi> that the other thought not of; It is true thought he, I tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the life of <hi>Uriah,</hi> that thou mindſt not, and God hath ſent yonder man to call my ſin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53448:70"/> therefore you ſons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> I will not meddle with you, nor doe you meddle with him, let him alone. So if thou be a <hi>humbled</hi> man, whatſoever the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> be, if the ſpirit of God hath <hi>humbled</hi> thy heart, preſently thou wilt looke upon <hi>God,</hi> God hath made yonder <hi>Neighbour</hi> vex me; and when thou commeſt home perhaps thy <hi>Husband</hi> raves, and railes, <hi>God</hi> hath ſtirred up the paſſion of my <hi>Husband,</hi> and made him doe thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</p>
                     <p>This is one thing that I finde frequent in the Scriptures, to be an act, or an expreſſion of a <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> heart in the time of afflictions. Nay I find <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> people have ſtrange expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 26. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were carried captive, and there came lions and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people of <hi>Aſsiria,</hi> that came to dwell there, and the people goe home and ſay, <hi>The God of the Land hath ſent Lions among us, becauſe we know not the manner of the God of the Land;</hi> how many of us that are called Chriſtians, when things fall out, we fall foule with the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> with the <hi>rod,</hi> or the <hi>Axe,</hi> or the <hi>ſtaffe,</hi> this, or that man, did this, or that; when the very <hi>Heathen</hi> could ſay, the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi> hath ſent Lions, much more ſhould a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> whoſe heart God hath <hi>humbled.</hi> That is one inſtance.</p>
                     <p>A Second thing is this, you ſhall diſcerne, and <note place="margin">2. He hath high thoughts of God.</note> ſee a <hi>humble</hi> heart in <hi>afflictions,</hi> by the <hi>high</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend;</hi> and <hi>pretious</hi> thoughts, that he hath then of God. A humble heart hath <hi>glorious</hi> thoughts of God in the <hi>loweſt</hi> condition. As for inſtance, he ſees there glorious things in God, in his affliction,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53448:70"/> that makes him thinke <hi>reverently,</hi> and <hi>honourably,</hi> and <hi>dearely,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſayth,) of him.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, he ſees the <hi>juſtice</hi> of God; the <hi>equallneſſe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Of his juſtice.</note> of Gods dealing with his <hi>ſoule,</hi> or with his body, let the Lord doe with him what he will, he will not ſay as the people of Iſrael proverbially ſaid. <hi>Ezek. 18. The wayes of the Lord are not equall.</hi> A proud heart will <hi>ſay</hi> ſo; it will <hi>think</hi> ſo at leaſt: for the Scripture ſpeaks the language of mens <hi>hearts.</hi> The <hi>heart</hi> of a proud man thinks that God deales <hi>unjuſtly,</hi> and <hi>unequally,</hi> that he layes ſo great an affliction on him, and then another affliction upon that; that firſt takes away one mercy, and then <hi>another;</hi> firſt <hi>one</hi> Child, and then <hi>another,</hi> and then a <hi>third;</hi> the heart, out of <hi>pride,</hi> thinkes God deales <hi>unjuſtly;</hi> but if the heart were rightly humbled, it would ſee that all that God doth, is very <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>equall.</hi> I, not onely (obſerve it) juſt according to <hi>Law,</hi> for ſo a man may doe by <hi>legall humiliation,</hi> that <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> had. <hi>Judas</hi> ſaw that it was <hi>juſt</hi> with God to deſtroy him; and ſo did <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Pharoah:</hi> it is not onely <note place="margin">According to the Goſpel.</note> ſo, but according to the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> there he ſees that the wayes of God are very <hi>equall,</hi> and that it is a <hi>righteous</hi> thing with God to afflict him, I meane thus, a man I ſay under the <hi>Goſpell</hi> that ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the <hi>ſon</hi> of God, and that God is his Father, and that he is united to Chriſt, and that his ſoule is juſtifyed perfectly by the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt; yet when God ſhall lay ſome ſore affliction upon him. A man would thinke now, how can God <hi>juſtly</hi> doe this? As ſome proud or inconſiderate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſay: Will God be paid twice? hath he not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53448:71"/> beene paid in his ſon? Now a humble heart will ſay, though <hi>God</hi> be ſatiſfyed, and the <hi>Law</hi> be <hi>full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,</hi> and he is my <hi>Father;</hi> yet I am ſuch a <hi>graceles</hi> wretched <hi>ſon,</hi> ſuch a provoking <hi>ſon,</hi> I doe ſo often <hi>vex,</hi> and <hi>ſlight,</hi> and <hi>neglect</hi> my <hi>Father,</hi> that even according to the law of <hi>love:</hi> and according to the bleſſed <hi>Goſpell,</hi> it is <hi>equall</hi> that God ſhould deale ſo with me.</p>
                     <p>Nay he can ſay at all times that God layes on me (according to the Goſpell it ſelfe) leſſe then I <hi>deſerve,</hi> as they ſaid, <hi>Lament. 3. 22. It is the Lords mercie that we are not conſumed.</hi> Indeed it is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction that I am <hi>whipped,</hi> but it is a great deale of mercy that I am not utterly <hi>deſtroyed;</hi> Looke to thy heart in this thing, when afflictions come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, canſt thou <hi>juſtifie</hi> God, and ſay his wayes are <hi>equall,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>right,</hi> as they ſay in <hi>Nehem. 9. 33. Howbeit thou art juſt and right in all this.</hi> In all what? you ſhall ſee in the Verſe before, <hi>Lord let it not ſeeme little before thee, the trouble that hath come upon us, &amp;c.</hi> And it was not little, for they ſuffered ſore, and long, and yet notwithſtanding all that, thou art righteous, and juſt in all this, that we have ſuffered. That is one thing.</p>
                     <p>Another thing that he hath <hi>reverend</hi> thoughts <note place="margin">2. Of his Love.</note> of God for, it is his <hi>love,</hi> a humble heart wil be able to ſee a <hi>ſun</hi> through a <hi>cloud;</hi> he will be able to ſee the <hi>heart</hi> of a Father, and the <hi>love</hi> of a <hi>Father,</hi> when he frownes moſt, or ſhakes his rod moſt over him, God cannot ſhake his rod ſo much over a Saint that is a <hi>humbled</hi> Saint, but he will be able to eſpie ſome Smiles of <hi>love:</hi> Therefore I ſay he hath honourable thoughts of God, Why? Becauſe he
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53448:71"/> thinks though this be ſo, yet it is juſt, and <hi>equall.</hi> It is true ſayth he, I am a <hi>ſon,</hi> but of my conſcience God hath not ſuch another <hi>ſon,</hi> on the face of the Earth: I vex him more in one week, then all the other doe in a yeare: therefore for all this, I ſee him move his <hi>eies,</hi> and yearne his <hi>heart</hi> for my good; ſo that ſtill he hath honourable thoughts of God.</p>
                     <p>Now a <hi>proud</hi> heart, ſuch a one as <hi>Judas,</hi> may ſay it is <hi>juſt:</hi> but here he comes ſhort, he cannot ſay it is <hi>love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly and laſtly, he hath <hi>honourable,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, <note place="margin">3. Of his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> and reverend thoughts of God: becauſe in his affliction he diſcerns the infinite <hi>wiſdome</hi> of God. Truly Beloved, there are but <hi>two</hi> great <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi> that are great indeed, that are before the eye of a Chriſtian in this World: that is, the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">Two wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes great in the eyes of Saints.</note> that is hid in the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> that <hi>the Angells de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to prie into:</hi> and the <hi>wiſedome</hi> of God, in his carriage to his Saints in <hi>affliction.</hi> Now when things ſeem <hi>croſſe</hi> and thwart; when a proud heart ſayth, I am <hi>undone,</hi> I am broken, and <hi>ſpoyled;</hi> I ſhall never ſet up again, I ſhall never eat my bread <hi>chearfully</hi> againe; a humble heart can ſay, though I know not what God will doe, yet he hath a <hi>wiſe</hi> deſigne in it; it is <hi>love,</hi> whatſoever it is, and it is <hi>wiſedome</hi> too. Therefore the Lord doth with us in afflictions, as he did with <hi>Peter,</hi> when he waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his feet, ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> what doeſt thou meane? What I meane thou ſhalt know <hi>hereafter.</hi> So a poore Saint when God ſtrikes him; he takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it may be <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> of his Children: thinks he, Lord, what doeſt thou meane? Sayth
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53448:72"/> God, thou ſhalt know <hi>hereafter,</hi> I have a <hi>wiſe</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne thou ſhalt ſee it, but now I muſt keepe it from thee, thou ſhalt not know it. And truly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily when the affliction is over, God comes and takes his childe a ſide, and opens the deſigne to him, and tells him thou didſt <hi>wonder</hi> at me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, and hadſt <hi>hard</hi> thoughts of me for a great while when it was under ground; come now, I will read thee a leſſon, I will tell thee the ſtory; and ſo takes him by the hand, and ſayth, doeſt not thou remember before I tooke thee in hand, what a <hi>froward</hi> creature thou wert? what a <hi>proud</hi> creature thou wert? thou mighteſt have been <hi>damned,</hi> if I had not taken thee in hand; and I gave thee firſt ſuch a <hi>gentle</hi> affliction, and then added <hi>another.</hi> God ſhews him the whole plot, and then he ſayth, Lord pardon all my hard thoughts of thee; glorious God, I ſee now that all was <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>wiſedome.</hi> And God ſo inures his people to ſhew them the deſigne when the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is over, that moſt Saints, though they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and ſee nothing of God in their affliction, yet they know it is a glorious deſigne of <hi>wiſdome</hi> that God hath upon them: therefore they will not <hi>cenſure</hi> God, becauſe they ſee it not; it is but their owne ignorance that they doe not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it. As if you ſhould ſee a Plow-man, or a countrie man come to a <hi>Mathematician,</hi> that were at his Globe, and his compaſſes, and were drawing lines from one to another; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie man knowes nothing of this: but he would not therefore ſay the other is a <hi>foole,</hi> and doth he knoweth not what. He would rather ſay, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53448:72"/> you he is a <hi>Scholler,</hi> and hath had good <hi>breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> but allas what <hi>ſimple</hi> people are we in the Countrie, we know not what belongs to the <hi>Globe,</hi> and compaſſes. So a Chriſtian when he is in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, he doth not ſay, God doth he knows not what, and he <hi>plagueth</hi> me: but ſayth he, God hath <hi>wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> in all this; only I am a <hi>ſimple</hi> poore creature that know not this. So now there are two things I would have you to obſerve. Firſt if you have humbled hearts, you will <hi>ſee</hi> God in the affliction. And then you will have <hi>reverent</hi> and high thoughts of God, in reſpect of his <hi>juſtice</hi> and his <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>wiſdome</hi> towards you.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, a ſoule that is <hi>humbled</hi> (I meane all this while, as far as it is humbled) it <note place="margin">3. A humble ſoule quietly ſubmits in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> doth <hi>quyetly,</hi> and <hi>ſilently ſubmit</hi> unto the Lord in all his <hi>afflictions;</hi> that the Lord may doe with him what he will, and truly he hath reaſon enough and it cannot be otherwiſe; if he ſee God in the Inſtruments, and ſee ſuch thoughts of <hi>juſtice,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>wiſdome</hi> in God, he cannot but quyetly <hi>ſubmit;</hi> this will follow. As you know in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. When God told <hi>Ely</hi> that he was comming to <hi>cut</hi> off his <hi>houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and his <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and his <hi>Sonnes.</hi> Sayth he, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what ſemeeth good in his eyes.</hi> It is the Lord, I will not ſuffer my heart to <hi>grumble,</hi> but it is the Lord, and I will <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</hi> A man would have thought he had not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, he did <hi>chide</hi> his Sonnes, and told them, <hi>Ye doe not well;</hi> but he ſhould have <hi>corrected</hi> them: they were wicked men, and becauſe he was too <hi>Indulgent</hi> to them, God ſent him word that he would <hi>cut</hi> them <hi>off,</hi> both <hi>him,</hi> and his <hi>Sonnes,</hi> yet
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53448:73"/> ſaith he, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what ſeemeth good in his eyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, let a man be never ſo <hi>ſtout</hi> otherwiſe in <note place="margin">The ſtouteſt heart hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to God.</note> his naturall conſtitution, let him be of never ſo <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>ſturdie</hi> a ſpirit; yet i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I will give you one place to prove this, <hi>Iſa. 29. 1. 2. Woe to Ariel, to Ariel the City where David dwelt, let them kill, ſacrifice, yet I wil diſtreſſe Ariel.</hi> What is that? That is, <hi>the Lion of God.</hi> God calls Jeruſalem the <hi>Lion,</hi> and the <hi>Lion of God,</hi> you know the <hi>Lion</hi> is a ſtout creature.

                     <p>Trie your hearts by theſe things, how you are in afflictions: doe you ſee God in the <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi> What kind of <hi>thoughts</hi> have you of God?

And doe you ſubmit? can you <hi>ſtoop,</hi> and <hi>quench</hi> the <hi>boylings</hi> of your hearts, and the <hi>ſtirringe</hi> of your ſpirits? Can you ſay as <hi>Eli</hi> did. <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe as he will.</hi> He hath taken <hi>one</hi> child, let him take the <hi>reſt</hi> if he pleaſe; he hath taken <hi>one</hi> of my Familie, let him take <hi>more</hi> if he will.

                     <p>In the Fourth place, a <hi>humble</hi> ſoule that is <hi>ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">4.

But he giveth more grace; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble,</hi> He makes <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>envie</hi> one, and the ſame. And indeed ſo it is, you ſhall never ſee them ſevered, you ſhall never ſee a <hi>proud</hi> heart,

He ſpeaks of the proſperity of the ungodly, they flouriſhed in the World; and increaſed in riches, and ſayth he, <hi>Verily I have cleanſed my heart in vaine: for all the day long I am plagued, and whipped, and chaſtned every morning.</hi> It is a ſtrange thing ſayth he, ſee how yonder <hi>wicked</hi> man <hi>flouriſheth,</hi> and <hi>proſpers;</hi> and for my part I am as ſure to be <hi>whipped</hi> every morning, as I am of my break-faſt (as they ſay) <hi>But if I ſhould ſay ſo</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>I ſhould offend againſt the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Children.</hi> I thought ſo, till I went into the Sanctuary of God; and then he underſtood their end, and his owne folly: indeed it was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> weakneſſe: and it was that which his heart was not throughly <hi>humbled</hi> for, as it ſhould. Therefore you ſee proud people in the Propheſie of <hi>Malachi. Chap.</hi> 3.

                     <p>The Fift thing is this, that a ſoul that is truely <note place="margin">5. Humble hearts repent not of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt.</note> 
                        <hi>humbled</hi> in his afflictions, as he doth not <hi>envie</hi> the <hi>proſperity</hi> of others the while; ſo he doth not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> of his bargaine that he hath made in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt: though all his <hi>afflictions,</hi> and <hi>miſeries</hi> it may be fall on him for his <hi>ſake,</hi> or the moſt of them; he never <hi>repents</hi> that he hath been ſo holy, but that he is not more holy.</p>
                     <p>A proud heart repents of what it hath done for God.

                     <p>There is a bleſſed expreſſion, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 44. 9. Of <hi>David</hi> and the people of God, I have oft thought of the great ſufferings of the Saints there ſpoken of, <hi>Thou haſt caſt us off, and put us to ſhame, and goeſt not forth with our Armies. Thou makeſt us to turne back from the Enemy: and thoſe that hate us, ſpoyle for themſelves. Thou haſt given us like Sheepe appointed for meat: and haſt ſcattered us among the Heathen.</hi>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:53448:75"/> 
                        <hi>Thou ſelleſt thy people for nought, and doeſt not increaſe thy wealth by their price. A ſtrange thing, thou ſelleſt them, and takeſt no money for them. Thou makeſt us a reproach to our Neighbours, a ſcorne and deriſion to them that are round about us, &amp;c.</hi> Here is as it were an inventorie of all the troubles of the Church; and wherefore doth he ſpeake all this? you ſhall ſee after. <hi>For all this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neyther have we dealt falſely in thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Our heart is not turned back neyther have our ſteps declined from thy way. Though thou haſt ſore broken us in the place of Dragons, yet we have not ſtretched forth our hands to a ſtrange God.</hi> He rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons up all theſe troubles, and yet ſayth he, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, though God have brought all theſe miſeries upon us, yet <hi>We have not been falſe in the Covenant, nor ſtretched out our hands to a ſtrange God;</hi> we doe not repent that we have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> thee, and are <hi>married</hi> to thee, and have <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen</hi> thee for our <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I remember the practice of a godly Miniſter many yeares agoe, who ſpeaking of the manner how God uſeth to bring in ſinners to Chriſt; (though there were a great deale of curioſitie in thoſe dayes, more (if I may ſpeak with reverence to the worthy men that then lived) then ſhould have been) as if a man ſhould go about to deſcribe the forming of a child in the wombe, which it were better leave to God, then ſtudie too much how it is framed. But I remember his expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſayth he, God takes a ſinner the firſt time, and ſhewes him his <hi>miſerie,</hi> and ſhuts him up that he ſees no way of deliverance at all: and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53448:75"/> a little while he opens a little crevice that he may ſee deliverance, and Salvation but he gives him not the leaſt occaſion of hope that he ſhall have deliverance: but in the meane while what doth the ſinner? He <hi>leaves</hi> his ſins as faſt as he can, and turnes them off, and throwes them <hi>away.</hi> He ſees Salvation, and he ſayth, yonder is Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but I have no reaſon to hope to have it: but whether I have it or no, I will never goe back to <hi>ſin.</hi> I am reſolved whether Chriſt will give me <hi>pardon,</hi> and Salvation or not, I will not take <hi>ſin</hi> any more. I applie it to this; when afflictions and miſeries come in ſtormes on a poore ſoule, ſhower after ſhower, that there is no end; the ſoule ſayth. I know not how I ſhall be delivered from theſe troubles, here is death, and miſery, and ſickneſſe upon me, and I know not what the iſſue will be, but be the end what it will, by the helpe of God I will not goe <hi>back</hi> to ſin, I will not <hi>repent</hi> that I have received Chriſt, but will keepe <hi>cloſe</hi> to the Lord. This is the meaning of that phraſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. Where Chriſt ſaith when the <hi>ſun</hi> is up upon the <hi>corne</hi> it <hi>ſcorcheth</hi> it, that is, when there is <hi>Perſecution;</hi> (for every <hi>Perſecution</hi> is an <hi>affliction,</hi> though every <hi>affliction</hi> be not a <hi>Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> now when the ſun of Perſecution is up) <hi>men are offended.</hi> What is the meaning of that? Men <hi>repent</hi> of their bargaine, they begin to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that ever they were Profeſſors of Religion. Therefore the Lord Chriſt would have a man caſt up the <hi>coſt.</hi> For when a <hi>man</hi> enters into Religion, it is as if he were to <hi>fight</hi> a <hi>Field,</hi> there will be <hi>loſſe,</hi> and <hi>trouble,</hi> and <hi>danger,</hi> there will be tribulation,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53448:76"/> and hot <hi>Perſecution;</hi> conſider if thou be able to goe through it: thou muſt have the ſhell as well as the kernell, it is a decree of Heaven. Therefore conſider before hand that thou mayeſt not <hi>repent</hi> when troubles come. There may be baſe times, worſe then yet, if worſe may be; and if when tribulations come thou ſhalt <hi>repent</hi> that thou haſt gone ſo <hi>farr</hi> in Religion, and that thou haſt been acquainted with the <hi>Saints,</hi> and that thou haſt been ſo <hi>oft</hi> in their <hi>companie,</hi> thou haſt (to ſpeake the leaſt, and the beſt of thee) an <hi>unhumbled</hi> heart.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, a Saint that hath a <hi>humbled</hi> heart, you <note place="margin">6. He is more carefull to carry himſelfe aright, then to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> may know it by his <hi>carriage</hi> in afflictions by this, he is more carefull by far of his <hi>right</hi> carriage in it, then of <hi>deliverance</hi> out of it. That is alway in a <hi>humble</hi> heart, he ſtudies more how to <hi>behave</hi> himſelfe like a Saint under the <hi>rod,</hi> then how to get away, and be <hi>delivered</hi> from it. You may read in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. There was very hot perſecution, and great <hi>affliction</hi> upon the Saints; and yet there they are <hi>bleſsing</hi> God notwithſtanding all their Perſecution, to ſee the Scripture fullfilled; that which was ſpoken in <hi>Pſal. 2. The Kings of the Earth ſtand up, and the Rulers take counſell together, againſt the Lord, and againſt his anoynted;</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced to ſee that fullfilled, as if they had ſaid, they <hi>killed Chriſt</hi> the other day, and now they <hi>Perſecute us.</hi> Now what would you, and I have asked had we been in their condition? O that God would <hi>deliver</hi> us, that he would ſhew us an <hi>Iland</hi> where we might never be troubled more; many of us would have done this out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53448:76"/> but what doe they doe? Verſ. 29. <hi>And now Lord behold their threatnings.</hi> And what then?

Now a <hi>humble</hi> heart as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe. <hi>Though he kill me yet will I truſt in him.</hi> So ſayth a humble heart, let him <hi>kill</hi> me yet I will <hi>obey</hi> him.

A <hi>proud</hi> heart alwayes goes from God in affliction. As we ſee <hi>Judas,</hi> he went not to <hi>God,</hi> but to the <hi>halter;</hi> and <hi>Caine,</hi> he went to the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> when God was angrie he went to buyld Townes, he did not goe to God, and lay hold upon the Covenant: ſo <hi>Saul</hi> he goes to <hi>Endor,</hi> to the <hi>VVitch</hi> in ſtead of going to <hi>God,</hi> and laying better <hi>hold</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> So a <hi>proud</hi> heart departs from God, and growes <hi>further</hi> off, and looſer from God, whereas alway in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a <hi>humble</hi> heart ſticks <hi>cloſer</hi> to God and gets better hold of his bleſſed covenant.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This I did open, and proove fully to you, out of the Scriptures. And ſo as God led us we went along. And came in the laſt place to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our ſelves: (for that we were upon) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord had truely <hi>humbled</hi> us by diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>himſelfe</hi> to us: For there is no ſoul that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>humbled,</hi> but he that hath <hi>ſeen</hi> God in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I ſpeak not, as I told you, of a <hi>day</hi> of <hi>humiliation,</hi> or of the <hi>dutie</hi> of <hi>humiliation,</hi> or of a <hi>preparatory humiliation,</hi> but of the Goſpel-<hi>grace</hi> of <hi>humiliation,</hi>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:53448:81"/> of that frame of heart that is, or ought to be in a Saint at all times. For the diſcovery of it, I told you, we ſhould find much of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, by our <hi>carriage</hi> towards <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, by our <hi>carriage</hi> towards <hi>man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Towards <hi>God;</hi> I told you firſt in reſpect of his <hi>righteouſneſſe.</hi> And indeed therein cheifly is diſcovered the <hi>pride</hi> of our hearts, or the <hi>humility</hi> of our hearts by our receiving, or not receiving the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of God by faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by our carriage to the <hi>truths</hi> of God, therein we may ſee how much of this grace God hath beſtowed upon us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly by the <hi>commands</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, by the <hi>corrections</hi> of God. And therein I ſhewed you what the poſture of the heart of a Chriſtian is, that is truly and ſavingly <hi>humbled</hi> by his carriage in <hi>afflictions.</hi> For if there be <hi>pride</hi> in the ſoule, uſually <hi>affliction</hi> will bring it out. I ſhall not repeat any thing but goe on a little further to that which remaines.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing more, and but one thing <note place="margin">5. A humble hearts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note> that I ſhall ſpeake of in reſpect of our carriage towards <hi>God,</hi> wherein you ſhall diſcover how much God hath given you of this grace; and that is by your carriage towards God in the way of his <hi>mercies.</hi> Truly <hi>mercies,</hi> and <hi>afflictions</hi> are much like <hi>Summer,</hi> and winter; and ſometimes our <hi>ſickneſſe</hi> will breake out in <hi>Winter</hi> that is conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Summer,</hi> and ſometimes it is diſcovered in <hi>Summer</hi> that is hid in <hi>Winter.</hi> So in ſome ſoules the <hi>evills</hi> of the heart will breake out in <hi>afflictions</hi> more then in <hi>mercies,</hi> and in ſome it is more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53448:81"/> in a ſtate of <hi>proſperitie,</hi> in a way of <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> then in the way of <hi>afflictions.</hi> As on the other ſide in ſome ſoules <hi>grace</hi> is more <hi>cleare,</hi> and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in <hi>afflictions</hi> then in <hi>proſperitie;</hi> and truely I think that in ſome ſoules grace will ſhine more in the way of <hi>mercy.</hi> And if God will come and have <hi>mercie</hi> upon poore England, my hope is, and it is my prayer, and requeſt to God that we may diſcover more <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> and more <hi>grace,</hi> then in all this time. We have diſcovered a great deale of <hi>pettiſhneſſe,</hi> and <hi>frowardneſſe,</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> and <hi>covetouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>cruelty,</hi> and <hi>raſhneſſe:</hi> but I hope (there being diverſe Saints among us) that God will give us another frame of heart, if he have <hi>mercy</hi> on us, and turne away his wrath. But that by the by. But I was ſaying that the <hi>pride</hi> of the heart, and other <hi>corruptions</hi> alſo, are <note place="margin">Corruptions diſcovered by Gods mercies.</note> ſometimes diſcovered in a way of <hi>mercie</hi> that are not diſcovered in a way of <hi>affliction.</hi> I will give you but one Scripture for it, in <hi>Hoſea 7. 1. VVhen I would have healed Iſrael, then the iniquity of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim was diſcovered, and the wickedneſſe of Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria: for they commit falſhood, &amp;c. Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael are</hi> two names almoſt of the ſame thing: though <hi>Ephraim</hi> were but <hi>one</hi> tribe yet becauſe it was a <hi>great</hi> tribe (as <hi>York</hi> is a <hi>great</hi> Countie in <hi>England)</hi> all <hi>Iſraell</hi> is often called by the name of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Now when God would <hi>heale Ephraim,</hi> or <hi>Iſraell,</hi> then their iniquity <hi>appeared.</hi> So it is to be feared that if God come to <hi>heal</hi> England as he ſeemeth to ſmile on us ſometimes, and according to that word in <hi>Acts</hi> 7. Where he ſayth, <hi>I have ſeen, I have ſeen, the afflictions of my people in Aegypt.</hi>
                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:53448:82"/> So I hope God hath ſeen, how the <hi>bread</hi> is done, and the <hi>proviſion</hi> is gone, and the <hi>people</hi> are ready to goe away themſelves, by reaſon of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. I hope God hath ſeen, and will put an <hi>end</hi> to our <hi>miſeries,</hi> and I much feare, that when <hi>mercie</hi> comes, and when <hi>peace</hi> comes, there will then be a <hi>diſcovery</hi> of <hi>rotten</hi> hearts then much more then in <hi>theſe</hi> times, yet in <hi>theſe</hi> times there are abundance of <hi>rotten</hi> hearts diſcovered that were not knowne before. The Lord comes near the <hi>quick</hi> of our profeſſion in theſe times: there are abundance that have been profeſſors that now <hi>jeere</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>diſhonour</hi> God, and <hi>imbrace the VVorld:</hi> but in times of <hi>mercie</hi> there will be <hi>more:</hi> the <hi>ſun</hi> makes the <hi>Traveller</hi> put off his <hi>cloake</hi> when the <hi>wind</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. But to open it to you as I did the former: that which I ſhall doe ſhall be to diſcover to you what the <hi>carriage</hi> of a <hi>humble</hi> heart is, and what our <hi>carriage</hi> ſhould be when God ſhewes <hi>mercie</hi> to us, when the Lord deales kindly with us in the way of his <hi>mercy.</hi> What is the poſture of a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, then?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, Firſt of all, a humble heart he can be <note place="margin">1. A humble heart content to be denyed any mercy.</note> content that the Lord ſhould <hi>denie</hi> him any <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> let it be never ſo <hi>deare</hi> or <hi>pretious</hi> to him; though he <hi>prize</hi> it high, and <hi>pray</hi> earneſtly for it, and <hi>wayt</hi> long for it, yet if God come at laſt and ſay thou ſhalt <hi>not</hi> have it; he can be content <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,</hi> and <hi>meekly</hi> to take a <hi>denyall</hi> from God and goe away contented if it muſt be ſo.</p>
                     <p>Indeed there is a kind of <hi>earneſtneſſe</hi> that ſhould be in us, and in a ſence we ſhould take no <hi>deniall</hi> from God, we ſhould not be eaſily put off.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53448:82"/> As we ſee in <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. That Woman of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> when Chriſt put her off, ſhee comes <hi>again,</hi> and <hi>again,</hi> and <hi>again.</hi> But if God ſay, ſay <hi>no more,</hi> it ſhall not be ſo; rhen a man ſhould quietly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe to God: though like <hi>Hannah,</hi> he deſire Children and pray earneſtly and ſeek God <hi>againe,</hi> and <hi>againe,</hi> and ſeeme to be <hi>near</hi> towards it ſometimes, but at laſt if God come, and ſay thou ſhalt <hi>never</hi> have a <hi>child,</hi> then ſayth a proud heart <hi>Give me children, or I die.</hi> I will give you an inſtance or two of this, in 2 <hi>Sam 15. 25. David</hi> there was in a <hi>poore</hi> condition, he was <hi>purſued</hi> by his <hi>enemy,</hi> by <hi>Abſalom</hi> his owne <hi>ſon;</hi> and <hi>David</hi>

This is the poſture of a <hi>humble</hi> ſoule that deſireth <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> and the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> mercy, yet if God ſay, <hi>I have no delight in thee.</hi> I will doe none of theſe things; he can ſay, here I

                     <p>I will give you one inſtance more, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 3. 24. You have <hi>Moſes</hi> there praying; and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires a <hi>great</hi> requeſt; and that <hi>earneſtly</hi> of God. <note place="margin">Moſes.</note>

                     <p>Truely ſome godly men are of opinion that a <hi>Saint</hi> can come to this to be <hi>content</hi> that God ſhould deny him everlaſting <hi>Salvation</hi> for his ſoul. I have read of one, and I have ſpoken with another, I have knowne <hi>two</hi> godly men in that poſture, the one <hi>was</hi> ſo; and the other <hi>ſeemed</hi> to be ſo by his writing; that if after all the <hi>meanes</hi> uſed, he cannot come to <hi>beleive</hi> as others doe, that he can have no <hi>aſſurance,</hi> or <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>life</hi> from God; but that God almoſt in every <hi>Ordinance</hi> doth as much as tell him, thou ſhalt be <hi>damned,</hi> yet he can be content to goe to <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelfe. I have ſeen a glorious <hi>Saint,</hi> that hath ſaid, that if God ſhould tell him he ſhould be <hi>damned,</hi> yet he could <hi>ſubmit</hi> without <hi>murmuring.</hi> Such a thing may be, but I think it is not ordinary: neyther <note place="margin">Grace croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> doth God expect it becauſe <hi>grace</hi> never croſſeth the ground <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>nature;</hi> and of all, this
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53448:84"/> is the cheife principle that the <hi>creature</hi> ſhould <hi>deſire</hi> its owne <hi>preſervation.</hi> It is ſo in all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Grace <hi>ſcrews</hi> up, and makes nature <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> but grace goes not contrary to the <hi>mayne,</hi> and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid <hi>principles</hi> of pure <hi>nature.</hi> Now therefore I ſay, that a man by grace ſhould be brought to <hi>wiſh</hi> his owne <hi>deſtruction,</hi> it is very <hi>harſh.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it is contrary to the <hi>principle</hi> of nature, <note place="margin">Ground of true ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God.</note> it is contrary to the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of adoption; for what is it that makes me <hi>ſubmit</hi> to God? It is becauſe I have <hi>loving</hi> thoughts of him, and I conceive of his <hi>love</hi> to <hi>me,</hi> and the like: if I ſhould looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God as an <hi>enemie,</hi> I ſhould love him no more then the <hi>Devill</hi> himſelfe doth; it is ordinarily ſo. But what may be in <hi>one</hi> ſoul, or <hi>two,</hi> or a <hi>few,</hi> I know not. But that which I meane is in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mercies, eſpecially in <hi>temporall</hi> mercies, it is the frame of a <hi>humble</hi> heart to ſit ſtill, and be <hi>quyet</hi> if God <hi>denie</hi> the <hi>mercie.</hi> That is one thing.</p>
                     <p>Another thing is this, that as a <hi>humble</hi> heart <note place="margin">2.

It is juſt with a <hi>humble</hi> heart towards <hi>God,</hi> as you read of an <hi>honeſt</hi> hearted <hi>man</hi> in the Book of God that was <hi>humble</hi> towards <hi>David,</hi> you ſhall read of him in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 24.

So a <hi>humble</hi> heart carries himſelfe thus towards God, that when the Lord ſeems to be as it were in a holy <hi>chafe,</hi> and anger, that he takes away his <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> he takes away a <hi>child,</hi> or a <hi>husband,</hi> or a mans <hi>eſtate,</hi> or the like; if thou have a <hi>humble</hi> heart, thou wilt not be in a <hi>rage,</hi> and ſay <hi>let</hi> him take <hi>all,</hi> in a deſperate <hi>humour:</hi> but he ſayth <hi>meekly,</hi> let him take <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> or <hi>all,</hi> if he will, ſo I may injoy <hi>him,</hi> and his <hi>love,</hi> I will bleſſe God.</p>

                     <p>Now looke a little upon your hearts, how you finde your ſpirits when God hath <hi>denied</hi> you <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;</hi> when God hath <hi>taken</hi> away mercies. As I could give you many inſtances, but to name one or two, it may be when thou wert a <hi>carnall</hi> man that thou wert a very <hi>honourable</hi> man in thy <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie;</hi> thou wert the onely <hi>Stateſ-man,</hi> the man that did doe all the <hi>buſineſſes</hi> but now ſince thou art <hi>Religious,</hi> thou art <hi>deſpiſed,</hi> and there are <hi>none</hi> that make uſe of thee; thy <hi>honour</hi> is gone.

                     <p>Another thing, in reſpect of the <hi>mercies</hi> of <note place="margin">3. A humble heart will wait for mercies.</note> God is this, that a <hi>humble</hi> heart can be content to <hi>wait</hi> upon the Lord though he <hi>ſtay</hi> never ſo <hi>long</hi> for the <hi>leaſt</hi> mercie. <hi>Proud</hi> hearts unleſſe you feed them in <hi>haſt</hi> they will be gone. A <hi>proud</hi> heart will

The viſion is for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry. Behold his ſoul which is lifted up is not upright in him, but the juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> The <hi>proud</hi> heart, and the <hi>juſt</hi> man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by faith are put oppoſite one to the other: the <hi>juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> that is, though he <hi>deſire</hi> mercies, yet he ſhall be content to <hi>waite</hi> on God; but he that hath his ſoul <hi>lifted</hi> up he will be <hi>gone,</hi> he will not <hi>ſtay</hi> for God; juſt like that wicked King that you read of in the Book of God. <hi>This evill ſayth he, comes of the Lord, what ſhould I ſtay for him any longer?</hi> a wretched man. So an <hi>unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled heart</hi> ſayth, what ſhould I <hi>ſtay</hi> for God any longer in this? and ſo he takes <hi>baſe</hi> courſes to helpe himſelfe, and will not <hi>waite</hi> upon God, and goe in Gods wayes.</p>
                     <p>It is a thing highly commended in the Saints throughout all the Scriptures, when they had a frame of heart to <hi>waite</hi> on God. As <hi>Abraham the father of the faithfull;</hi> we read of him in <hi>Acts</hi> 7. VVhen God brought him from his fathers <hi>houſe,</hi> and from his whole eſtate, and led him abroad from one place to another, and had brought him at the laſt to the Land of Canaan, where he had not one foot of land, and his poſterity was not to poſſeſſe it of foure hundred yeares after, yet he <hi>bleſſeth</hi> God, and rayſeth <hi>Altars</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God did all this. Examine your hearts by this.</p>

                     <p>Againe, as a <hi>humble</hi> heart can be content that <note place="margin">4. A humble heart content with the leaſt mercies.</note> God ſhould <hi>denie</hi> him any mercy, and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> be content that God ſhould take away any mercy; and <hi>thirdly,</hi> be content to <hi>waite</hi> upon God for mercies. So in the fourth place after all his <hi>waiting</hi> he can be content with the <hi>leaſt</hi> pittance of <hi>mercie.</hi> A <hi>proud</hi> heart will not doe ſo; take a <hi>proud</hi> beggar and make him <hi>waite</hi> an houre or two, and then after give him but a <hi>farthing,</hi> and he will grumble that he ſhould ſtay ſo long, and looſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cuſtomers, others that might have releeved, and helped him: but a <hi>humble</hi> heart is content to <hi>waite</hi> long, and after all is content with a <hi>little.</hi> I will give you but one inſtance. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 26. There was a bleſſed woman that followed Chriſt for a <hi>mercie;</hi> Chriſt was <hi>ſilent</hi> a while, and ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and though ſhee cried out, yet he ſayth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. At laſt he calls her <hi>dog,</hi> ſayth ſhee, am I a <hi>dog,</hi> I take it well, but <hi>the dogs</hi> (ſayth ſhee) <hi>eat the crums that fall from their Maſters table.</hi> What is the meaning of that? You know the <hi>dog</hi> ſtayes till his Maſter have dined; and when his Maſter hath dined he is content with a <hi>bone,</hi> or with the leaſt <hi>cruſt</hi> that falls. The dog is not ſerved pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, as ſoone as his Maſter ſits downe; but he ſtayes till all have dined, and if a <hi>bone</hi> or a <hi>bit</hi> fall, he is content with that. A <hi>humble</hi> heart is like a dog in that, he will <hi>ſtay</hi> his maſters time; as that woman, ſhee could <hi>ſtay</hi> Jeſus Chriſts leaſure, and ſee him carve <hi>mercies</hi> upon other mens trenchers, and ſhe have but a <hi>bone,</hi> or a cruſt, or a <hi>bit</hi> of bread when all was done, and yet be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:53448:86"/>
                     <p>The Fifth thing is this, that a <hi>humble</hi> heart in <note place="margin">5. He is thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for a heart to receive mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note> reſpect of Gods <hi>mercies</hi> he will be <hi>content,</hi> and <hi>thankfull</hi> to God to give him a <hi>hand,</hi> and a <hi>heart,</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> mercies. That is a great meaſure of this grace of Goſpell <hi>humiliation,</hi> when God gives a man a little <hi>mercie</hi> after all his waiting; he ſees his owne <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> though the Lord be <hi>rich</hi> in mercie, yet he cannot <hi>take</hi> it, though it be <hi>layd</hi> downe upon the <hi>naile,</hi> yet he cannot take it up, without God <hi>give</hi> him a <hi>heart.</hi> It is not ſo with the poore beggers of the World; if you give them <hi>money</hi> they have a <hi>purſe</hi> to lay it up in; if you give them <hi>meat</hi> they have a <hi>budget</hi> to put it in: but the ſoul is not able to receive any <hi>mercie,</hi> I mean not any <hi>ſpirituall</hi> mercie; <hi>temporall</hi> mercies it may, but not <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> unleſſe God give a hand, and a heart to receive it.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen poore women in the Mountaines of VVales (and I have oft thought of it) they have been ſo poor that when they have come to a houſe to <hi>beg</hi> a little <hi>whey</hi> or <hi>butter-milke,</hi> they have been fain to beg the loane of a <hi>pot,</hi> or a <hi>diſh</hi> to put it in. So we, when we come to beg mercie of God; we muſt deſire the Lord when we have done our beſt, to give us <hi>eyes</hi> to ſee it, and a <hi>heart</hi> to lay it up, and a <hi>hand</hi> to receive it: for <hi>the naturall man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not the things of God.</hi> And <hi>beleiving</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>receiving;</hi> and it is <hi>the gift of God to beleive.</hi> We cannot <hi>believe,</hi> that is, we cannot <hi>receive</hi> the leaſt mercie of God, unleſſe he give us <hi>hands,</hi> and <hi>hearts.</hi> This is the diſpoſition of a <hi>humble</hi> heart; when I pray for <hi>mercie</hi> of God, I ſee God is <hi>full</hi> of <hi>mercie,</hi> and Chriſt is a <hi>Fountaine</hi> full of <hi>grace;</hi>
                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:53448:87"/> but I have not <hi>eyes</hi> to behold it; I have not a <hi>hand</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> it. We cannot <hi>carrie</hi> one <hi>graine</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> home, unleſſe God give us ſpirituall <hi>buckets.</hi> As that woman ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 4. Here is <hi>water,</hi> but where is the <hi>bucket</hi> to draw? So God may ſay, thou wanteſt <hi>grace,</hi> but where is thy <hi>bucket?</hi> ſayth the <hi>humble</hi> ſoul, Lord I have <hi>none,</hi> thou muſt both give the <hi>water,</hi> and lend the <hi>bucket</hi> to carry it home.</p>
                     <p>And then Sixtly, a <hi>humble</hi> heart is diſcovered by this, that when the Lord ſhall give him any <note place="margin">6. He is content that God give lawes how to uſe his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note> mercie, he will be content that God ſhall give him as many <hi>laws</hi> as he will to <hi>uſe</hi> theſe mercies, a <hi>humble</hi> heart will doe ſo. A <hi>proud</hi> begger if you give him a couple of ſhillings and ſay be ſure you buy you ſome <hi>cloaths</hi> with this, or get ſome <hi>good</hi> thing for your <hi>wife,</hi> and <hi>children;</hi> he will be ready to ſay you need not tell <hi>me</hi> how I ſhall <hi>uſe</hi> it, I know <hi>what</hi> to doe with it. Now give a humble begger foure or five ſhillings, and ſay carrie <hi>one</hi> to your <hi>wife,</hi> and with <hi>two</hi> ſhillings buy you a paire of <hi>ſhooes,</hi> and doe <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>this:</hi> he will be content to doe <hi>all</hi> you tell him, make as many <hi>lawes</hi> as you will, if you give him <hi>any</hi> thing. It is juſt ſo with the ſoul of a <hi>humbled</hi> Chriſtian, when the Lord gives a <hi>mercy</hi> to a <hi>proud</hi> heart, he is ready to ſay I know <hi>what</hi> to doe with it well enough; but when he gives any thing to a humble Saint, he is content that the Lord ſhould teach him. And thence it is that when the Lord offers <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> and offers <hi>Chriſt</hi> to a <hi>proud</hi> heart, he is <hi>content</hi> to take the <hi>mercie,</hi> but he would goe <hi>on</hi> in his <hi>ſins</hi> ſtill: but hold ſayth Chriſt, now thou receiveſt <hi>Salvation,</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> thou muſt not
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53448:87"/> live in thy <hi>old</hi> wayes, thou muſt ſhake off thy old <hi>companie,</hi> and be a new man. No, the <hi>proud</hi> heart will have none of all thoſe, he would take the <hi>mercie,</hi> but he will goe on in his <hi>owne</hi> way. But a <hi>humble</hi> man is as <hi>Abraham,</hi> we ſee he <hi>ſtayed</hi> long for a child, and then God gave him a ſon; and when he had his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> God gave him a <hi>law</hi> for <hi>Iſaac. Abraham</hi> ſayth he, there is a <hi>ſon,</hi> and a great mercie, and <hi>all Nations ſhall be bleſſed in him:</hi> but thou muſt take thy <hi>ſon,</hi> and carry him to <hi>ſuch</hi> a place, and with thine <hi>owne</hi> hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a <hi>hill,</hi> thou muſt <hi>cut</hi> his throat: and ſome of the old Rabbins ſay, that he was to take a <hi>pole,</hi> and to ſtir his <hi>bowells</hi> in the <hi>fire;</hi> and according as the Lord, ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> handled his mercie. Thus it is with an humble heart.</p>
                     <p>But laſtly, and ſo I ſhall conclude; a <hi>humble</hi> heart towards God in the way of his <hi>mercie,</hi> is <note place="margin">New mercies added, add to his thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> diſcovered by this, that every <hi>addition</hi> of <hi>mercie</hi> that God beſtowes upon him, obligeth his <hi>heart</hi> more, and more, to a holy <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> and <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> And truely (as I have ſayd) we oft <hi>break</hi> our <hi>communion</hi> with God by our <hi>unthankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and our <hi>unthankfulneſſe</hi> ariſeth from the <hi>pride</hi> of our hearts. A <hi>proud</hi> heart thinks that <note place="margin">Proud hearts unthankfull.</note> he hath alwayes too <hi>little;</hi> therefore he is <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for more, but he forgets to pray with <hi>thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi> to <hi>make</hi> his <hi>requests known with thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi> Now let a <hi>humble</hi> heart be in never ſo much <hi>diſtreſſe,</hi> and <hi>miſery,</hi> the man can ſee abundance of cauſe to <hi>prayſe</hi> God; if he have but <hi>water</hi> that the beaſts drink, and if he have but <hi>ſtrength</hi> to <hi>dig,</hi> he can ſay, Lord I owne <hi>this</hi> as a <hi>mercie,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53448:88"/> is on <hi>this</hi> ſide <hi>Hell</hi> is <hi>mercie.</hi> So in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>I beſeech you by the mercies of God, that you give up your ſelves, a living, and holy, and acceptable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God.</hi> He would have the <hi>mercies</hi> of God to bring them to <hi>obedience,</hi> to give up themſelves to <hi>obey</hi> God. So in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. Sayth he, <hi>Doeſt thou deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe his riches, and goodneſſe, and forbearance, and long ſuffering; not knowing that the goodneſſe of God ſhould lead thee to repentance.</hi> The <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of God, and the <hi>patience</hi> of God, and the <hi>mercie</hi> of God; ſhould lead all <hi>humble</hi> hearts to a holy <hi>thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> and ſo it doth. And the more the Lord doth <hi>multiplie mercies</hi> upon him, the more <hi>obedient,</hi> and <hi>thankfull</hi> he is.</p>
                     <p>Now in all this that I have ſaid, I would deſire you to <hi>examine</hi> your ſoules, and if you find that in any of <hi>theſe,</hi> or in any of the <hi>reſt</hi> that I am yet to ſpeake of, you are <hi>faultie,</hi> and come ſhort; yet I would not have you conclude, therefore I am not the <hi>humbled</hi> ſoul that the Miniſter ſpake off, there is none of this grace in me: for though it be not ſo with thee in <hi>every</hi> poynt, though thou come ſhort of <hi>perfect</hi> humiliation that ſhould be in thee, it followes not that therefore there is <hi>none</hi> at all. The end why I put theſe things before you, is not ſo much to <hi>trie</hi> your ſelves, as that you might <hi>labour</hi> with the Lord to bring <hi>up</hi> your <hi>hearts</hi> to theſe things. And I have the rather choſen to ſpeake of this at this time, becauſe me thinks the Lord is <hi>preparing</hi> to come towards us in a <hi>way</hi> of <hi>mercie;</hi> and that I would have you to think of, and pray for, that the Lord may ſtill come in a way of <hi>mercie,</hi> that he may <hi>turne</hi> from
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53448:88"/> the <hi>evill</hi> he hath intended, or elſe he may eaſily bring us againe to the <hi>red</hi> ſea if we provoke him as we have done. But ſo much for this time.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall leave to ſpeake of our carriage towards <hi>Saints</hi> for the laſt: becauſe it will require a little more time; and becauſe I ſhall ſpeake but a few words of this, of the carriage of a humble heart towards <hi>ſinners,</hi> and that I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you at this time. Therefore breifly, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath this <hi>humble</hi> frame of heart, his carriage towards ſinners is according to the rule that we <note place="margin">1. To ſinners, with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> read of, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 2. To <hi>ſpeake evill of no man, to be gentle, ſhewing all meekneſſe unto all men.</hi> His
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53448:90"/> carriage I ſay is <hi>meek.</hi> and <hi>affable,</hi> and <hi>courteous,</hi> and <hi>gentle,</hi> towards all men.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, there is <hi>no</hi> heart in the World ſo <hi>proud</hi> (you ſhall obſerve it) but it hath in it <hi>ſome meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and eſpecially to <hi>ſome</hi> men. The <hi>proudeſt</hi> Tyrants in the World have had ſome <hi>favourites</hi> that they did <hi>fawne</hi> on, and in ſome ſort might be termed <hi>meek</hi> men: but the Apoſtle ſayth that we muſt ſhew <hi>all meekneſſe,</hi> and that unto <hi>all men:</hi> to <hi>all ſorts</hi> of men, <hi>to whoremongers,</hi> to <hi>drunkards,</hi> to thoſe that <hi>deprive</hi> us of our <hi>goods,</hi> and of our good <hi>name,</hi> which is hard to doe: but I will give you a Scripture that will open it. <hi>Colloſ. 1. 9. I pray for you,</hi> ſayth Paul <hi>that you may be filled with the knowledg of his will, in all wiſdome and ſpirituall underſtanding,</hi> &amp;c. If the Lord hath <hi>revealed</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that thou haſt had a ſaving <hi>ſight</hi> of him, then the Lord <hi>humbleth</hi> thy heart. How will that <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare?</hi> By thy carriage to all men, there will be <hi>all</hi> meekneſſe to <hi>all</hi> men. It will appeare by thy <hi>affabilitie,</hi> for <hi>meekneſſe</hi> and <hi>humbleneſſe</hi> have the ſame name in the Originall. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a <hi>humble</hi> man, and <hi>Moſes</hi> was a very <hi>meeke</hi> man. VVhere ever there is a <hi>humble</hi> heart, it is a <hi>meeke</hi> heart; there will be meekneſſe ſhewed even to <hi>ſinners.</hi> That you may ſee this, I will give you but one ſolid inſtance inſtead of many. You know that of all proud men there were none that had the name ſo much as the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> therefore they are called the <hi>proud Phariſees.</hi> And of all that have <note place="margin">Chriſts meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> been <hi>humbled,</hi> there was not ſuch a patterne of <hi>humilitie</hi> as our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now you ſhall ſee how the <hi>pride</hi> of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> was expreſſed,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53448:91"/> and how the <hi>humilitie</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> is ſet forth by his carriage to ſinners. As he ſayth, <hi>Mat. 11. 28. Come, and learne of me: for I am meeke and lowly of heart.</hi> It is becauſe of the <hi>pride</hi> of our hearts that we are not <hi>meeke:</hi> you ſhall ſee this <hi>meekneſſe</hi> of Chriſt by paralell places, in <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 34. You ſhall finde there, that our Lord Chriſt was at a feaſt: when he ſat at meat in a <hi>Phariſes</hi> houſe, there comes in a <hi>woman,</hi> and ſhee was <hi>waſhing</hi> his <hi>feet,</hi> and <hi>wyping</hi> them with the <hi>haire</hi> of her <hi>head,</hi> as he ſate at the table. The Phariſees fall a reaſoning with themſelves: <hi>Surely if he were a Prophet</hi> ſay they, <hi>he would have knowne what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of woman this is; for ſhee is a ſinner.</hi> VVe did hope he had been a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and a good man, but ſure hee is no <hi>Prophet,</hi> for then hee would know what this <hi>woman</hi> is: for this woman is a <hi>Harlot,</hi> ſhee is a <hi>Whore;</hi> and if he were a <hi>Prophet,</hi> he would be as we are, he would have nothing to doe with her. Then Chriſt asks a queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>Creditor</hi> that had two <hi>Debtors,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſets forth himſelfe as a patterne of <hi>meekneſſe</hi> in <hi>converſing</hi> with, and <hi>forgiving</hi> the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; he was at a feaſt, and he doth not with <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> reproove the Phariſee and fall upon him, calling him <hi>hypocrite, &amp;c.</hi> But ſecretly whips the Phariſee upon anothers back as it were. So in <hi>John</hi> 8. There they brought a woman that was taken in adulterie, and ſet her before him, and ſayd, <hi>Maſter, this woman was taken in adulterie, in the very act, now Moſes in the law commanded us that ſuch ſhould be ſtoned, but what ſayeſt thou?</hi> Their <hi>end</hi> was to <hi>tempt</hi> Chriſt; but when they were thus
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53448:91"/> accuſing her, Chriſt <hi>ſtoopes</hi> downe, and <hi>writes</hi> in the ſand. Not as if our bleſſed Lord were wont to be idle, but he had rather doe any thing then heare <hi>malicious</hi> people be <hi>condemning</hi> poore <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Well at laſt they make him heare; and then he makes them an anſwer. <hi>He that is without ſin, let him caſt the firſt ſtone at her.</hi> He was loath to heare, and when he did heare he was loath to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne her, though ſhee was taken in the <hi>act,</hi> and though he <hi>hated</hi> the <hi>ſin,</hi> for this is not to plead for <hi>ſin,</hi> though it be for <hi>ſinners; He that is without ſin, let him caſt the firſt ſtone at her.</hi> Now ſee the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees in the next Chapter. There was a <hi>blind</hi> man whoſe <hi>eyes</hi> Chriſt had <hi>opened,</hi> and the Phariſees began to queſtion the man, and he begins to ſet forth Chriſt, and his power, and ſayth he, if this man were a <hi>ſinner</hi> he could not have done this: <hi>For God heareth not ſinners,</hi> and ſo they caſt the man out as a great <hi>ſinner.</hi> Beloved, people thinke it is their <hi>holineſſe</hi> to be <hi>churliſh,</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere,</hi> and <hi>bitter</hi> to poore ſinners. But I ſay, it is the <hi>pride</hi> of their <hi>hearts,</hi> the <hi>loftineſſe</hi> of their <hi>ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its.</hi> If ever they had ſeen the face of God in Chriſt Jeſus, their hearts would be <hi>meeke,</hi> they would <hi>ſhew all meekneſſe,</hi> even to the worſt of ſinners. In <hi>Luke.</hi>

                        </gap>5. The beginning. You ſhall read that Chriſt was a companion to poore ſinners, they came about him; he left the Phariſees at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Cautions in meekneſſe to ſinners.</note> end of the table, and he ſpeaks Parables in three long Chapters, to ſhew the neceſſitie of <note place="margin">1. Not to have communion with them in inſtituted worſhip.</note> the <hi>care</hi> of <hi>poore</hi> ſinners. I ſhall ſay no more of it. Examine, and try your ſelves by that. Only let me give you theſe cautions concerning that.</p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:53448:92"/>
                     <p>Firſt of all, in your meekneſſe, and courteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and affableneſſe to poore ſinners, <hi>take heed</hi> leaſt it draw you into <hi>companie,</hi> or <hi>communion</hi> with them in any <hi>inſtituted</hi> worſhip. Take that caveat, for though it be a glorious Goſpell-truth, yet you muſt take a few caveats, I ſay, beware of <hi>communion</hi> with them in any <hi>inſtituted</hi> worſhip. Indeed you <note place="margin">1. Sinners may be converſed with in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things.</note> may have <hi>communion</hi> with them in <hi>naturall</hi> things, you may in <hi>eating,</hi> and drinking, and <hi>buying,</hi> and <hi>ſelling, or elſe</hi> (as Chriſt ſaith) <hi>you muſt goe out of the World.</hi> And I ſpeak it out of experience thoſe <hi>ties</hi> and <hi>reſtrictions</hi> that you put upon your ſelves, to keepe you <hi>off,</hi> and to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> you from <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> it doth but <hi>harden</hi> them. The Apoſtle calls it a <hi>develiſh</hi> thing to <hi>forbid meats, and drinks, and Marriage.</hi> So, for you to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> your ſelves from <hi>ſinners</hi> by <hi>naturall</hi> things; to my <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>experience,</hi> and <hi>woe,</hi> it doth but <hi>harden</hi> them. Therefore you may in naturall things <hi>converſe,</hi> and be <hi>affable</hi> with them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you may be <hi>affable,</hi> and converſe <note place="margin">2. In winning Ordinances.</note> with them in <hi>winning</hi> Ordinances, that is, in <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> appointed by Chriſt, to <hi>win</hi> ſinners to be Saints, that is, the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the Goſpell: an <hi>I deot</hi> came into the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> among the <hi>Saints:</hi> and truely Beloved in my eye it is not commendable to <hi>ſever ſinners</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> in this Ordinance, in hearing the word of God preached.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we may joyne with them in <hi>naturall</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3. In naturall duties.</note> duties, that is (as I have formerly told you my opinion) in <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>ſinging,</hi> for <hi>ſinging</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>prayſing</hi> God, whether it be with a <hi>tune,</hi> or without a <hi>tune.</hi> Theſe were <hi>written</hi>
                        <pb n="171" facs="tcp:53448:92"/> in the <hi>hearts</hi> of men at the <hi>firſt;</hi> and when a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> man doth theſe things, he doth but his <hi>dutie; every</hi> man ſhould <hi>call</hi> upon the name of <hi>God.</hi> Therefore when a <hi>naturall</hi> man joynes with me in <hi>prayer,</hi> I doe not ſin: for it is a <hi>naturall</hi> thing: <note place="margin">Prayer a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall duty.</note> it is his <hi>dutie</hi> to <hi>pray;</hi> but if he <hi>pray</hi> without <hi>faith</hi> it is his ſin. Therefore if you aske, ſhall a <hi>naturall</hi> man <hi>pray</hi> or <hi>not</hi> pray? I anſwer, if he <hi>pray,</hi> he <hi>ſinneth,</hi> but if he pray not, he <hi>ſinneth twice;</hi> he ſinneth both in the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner.</hi> But now in <hi>inſtituted</hi> worſhip, in things that are meerly ſo, if there be a <hi>mixture</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>ſinners,</hi> it is <hi>defiling:</hi> for that Ordinance is not to <hi>win</hi> but to <hi>buyld</hi> up.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you muſt not have <hi>unneceſſarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Unneceſſary converſe with ſinners for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</note> with them, I doe not teach you to <hi>delight</hi> in the company of <hi>ſinners;</hi> for <hi>ſinners</hi> will <hi>delight</hi> in <hi>ſinners;</hi> as we ſay <hi>birds of a feather will be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> but we ſhould ſhew our <hi>meekneſſe</hi> to <hi>win</hi> them, and to <hi>edifie</hi> them. If I ſee one that is a <hi>drunkard,</hi> I will get within him to <hi>win</hi> him to Chriſt if I <hi>can.</hi> If I <hi>cannot</hi> I doe not ſay that you ſhould <hi>leave</hi> the company of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare</hi> to come at them, and take <hi>pleaſure</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for <hi>David</hi> tells you how he was affected when he was forced to be in evill company. <hi>Pſal. 120. 5. VVoe is me that I ſojourne in Meſech, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar.</hi> And ſo in the text. <hi>VVoe is me, I am undone, for I am a man of polluted lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a people of polluted lips.</hi> There is a great <hi>greife</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> in the heart of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to be among <hi>ſinners:</hi> but yet there is an abundance of <hi>joy,</hi> ſo far as he hath any hope
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53448:93"/> to doe any <hi>good:</hi> but take heed of unneceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation notwithſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, take heed of <hi>too</hi> neare an <hi>union</hi> with <note place="margin">3. Too near u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note> 
                        <hi>ſinners,</hi> you muſt keepe them at a <hi>diſtance:</hi> as in <hi>marriage</hi> that is a very <hi>neare union,</hi> for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſayth <hi>They two are one fleſh.</hi> Thoſe that are <hi>Saints</hi> after they are <hi>called</hi> they muſt be carefull that they <hi>marrie in the Lord,</hi> they muſt have <hi>fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> with thoſe that are in the <hi>light,</hi> and not in <hi>darkneſſe.</hi> I <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>love ſinners,</hi> ſo as to doe them all the <hi>good</hi> I can; but not ſo as to make <hi>him,</hi> my <hi>husband,</hi> or <hi>her</hi> my <hi>wife.</hi> And ſo there ought to be a care in the choyce of ſervants.</p>
                     <p>Not that it is utterly <hi>unlawfull:</hi> there are but a <note place="margin">Few things unlawfull.</note> 
                        <hi>few</hi> things that are <hi>unlawfull,</hi> under the Goſpell, though ſome there are. But I meane for <hi>ſervants,</hi> though it may be <hi>lawfull,</hi> yet it is very <hi>unneceſſarie</hi> to have too <hi>near</hi> union with <hi>carnall</hi> men, eſpecially in <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things: beſides the <hi>unfaithfulneſſe</hi> that may be found.</p>
                     <p>But eſpecially take <hi>heed</hi> of having any thing to <note place="margin">4. Not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in ſin.</note> doe with them in any of the <hi>works of darkneſſe.</hi> If a <hi>ſinner</hi> be excerciſed in a <hi>dutie</hi> that is <hi>naturall,</hi> I may goe a <hi>long</hi> with him, and <hi>joyne</hi> with him, or if it be as I ſaid, in a <hi>winning</hi> Ordinance, but I muſt take <hi>heed</hi> of <hi>joyning</hi> with him in any thing that is <hi>ſinful,</hi> as you have it ſet downe by the Apoſtle. 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 17. 18. VVherefore come out from among them, and be yee ſeperate ſayth the Lord, and touch not the uncleane thing, and I will receive you, And I will be a father unto you, and yee ſhall be my ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſayth the Lord Almightie.</hi> That place is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by ſome who take it as if the Apoſtle meant
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53448:93"/> that we ſhould ſo come <hi>out</hi> from <hi>ſinners</hi> as to have no <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>communion,</hi> or <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with them. We know the Apoſtle elſewhere teacheth us to <hi>ſhew all meekneſſe to all men,</hi> as I told you before. And why doth he doe ſo? I ſhall ſpeake a few words of that, and ſo have done for this time.</p>
                     <p>How is it poſſible that a <hi>Saint</hi> that is a <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtament</hi>

                     <p>Truly there are theſe <hi>foure reaſons</hi> for it, there <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Firſt, when he looks upon another that is a <hi>ſinner,</hi> he conſidereth that <hi>he</hi> hath been <hi>worſe</hi> then <note place="margin">1.

                     </p>
                     <p>Truly one cannot ſay I have been in every <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> act as <hi>bad,</hi> or <hi>worſe</hi> then any other: but yet in <hi>ſome</hi> ſence or <hi>other</hi> in ſome <hi>reſpect</hi> or other, <hi>any</hi> man may ſay he is the <hi>cheife of ſinners: Paul</hi> ſayd ſo in regard of his <hi>perſecution</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> and though otherwiſe he was <hi>honeſt,</hi> and <hi>better</hi> then <hi>moſt</hi> other men, yet there he accounted himſelfe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53448:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> the <hi>worſt</hi> of <hi>ſinners.</hi> That is one thing that makes a <hi>Saint</hi> to be <hi>mild,</hi> and <hi>affable</hi> in his carriage to <hi>ſinners,</hi> becauſe he hath been as <hi>bad,</hi> or <hi>worſe</hi> then they.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, in <hi>ſome</hi> reſpect a <hi>humble</hi> heart <note place="margin">2. He thinks himſelfe as bad ſtill.</note> he thinks himſelfe to be <hi>worſe</hi> ſtill. Truly, I will tell you a leſſon that it may be is a myſterie to ſome of you. Take the moſt <hi>glorious Saints</hi> that are, and they will tell you that all the <hi>good</hi> that is in them, it is rather <hi>paſsive</hi> then <hi>active;</hi> that is, he will ſay, I am <hi>carried</hi> on by <hi>God</hi> meerly, and by his <hi>ſpirit;</hi> it is God that doth it, I know not <hi>how</hi> nor <hi>why.</hi> So that though <hi>God</hi> doth work much <hi>good</hi> in them, yet they ſee themſelves <hi>paſsive,</hi> and not <hi>active,</hi> and they can ſay it is God that doth it, and not they. And therefore when they <hi>look</hi> upon themſelves in <hi>ſome</hi> reſpects, they can put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>below</hi> even the <hi>worſt</hi> of <hi>ſinners,</hi> the <hi>vilest</hi> of <hi>ſinners.</hi> And ſo we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> in that place 1 <hi>Tim. 1. I am the cheife of ſinners</hi> ſayth he, and yet to <hi>me was more mercie ſhewed then to all men, that I might be a patterne of Gods mercie to all men;</hi> therefore I have received <hi>more mercie,</hi> and more <hi>riches</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> then <hi>any</hi> man. And ſo a Saint may ſay I have had more mercies then <hi>that</hi> man; but I was <hi>paſsive</hi> in it, and if God did worke upon <hi>that</hi> man, but <hi>halfe</hi> that which he hath done on <hi>me,</hi> he would have been far <hi>better</hi> then I am.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he thinks though there be a difference, <note place="margin">3.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53448:94"/> he.

I began to ſpeake of this the laſt time. I told you, that men are of two ſorts: eyther <hi>Saints,</hi> or <hi>ſinners,</hi> according to the <hi>Scripture</hi> language: not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the curſed language of theſe <hi>times,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate men from every opinion, and call them <hi>Seekers,</hi> and <hi>Presbiterians,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> I know not what <hi>curſed</hi> languages; but I ſay all men, are eyther <hi>Saints,</hi> or <hi>Sinners:</hi> thou art eyther a <hi>Saint,</hi> or a <hi>Sinner.</hi> Chriſt hath but <hi>two names</hi> for men here: and will have but <hi>two hands</hi> when he comes to judge, his <hi>right</hi> hand; and his <hi>left</hi> hand, and there are but two <hi>places</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judgement, <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> So by our carriage towards <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Sinners</hi> we may know whether we have this grace of <hi>humiliation</hi> or no.

                     <p>I ſhall now proceed to the laſt thing of all, that is, our <hi>carriage,</hi> and demeanour to the <hi>Saints,</hi> and therein, becauſe we are now upon examination. I beſeech you in a ſpeciall manner to have an eye upon your hearts while I am ſpeaking that God may make this as a <hi>lookinglaſse</hi> to ſome <hi>proud</hi> ſouls that they may thereby ſee how it is with them.

                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:53448:97"/>
                     <p>Firſt, if thou be rightly humbled, thou doeſt uſually <hi>conceive</hi> thy <hi>ſelfe</hi> and thou art willing that <note place="margin">1.

I will give you but a Scripture, or two for it. 1 <hi>Cor. 15. Paul</hi> you know was a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saint: and truly in many things (as far as we may have leave to judg,) more glorious then any of the Apoſtles yet ſayth he, ſpeaking of thoſe that had ſeen our Lord; meaning the Apoſtles: <hi>He was ſeene of James, and of Cephas, &amp;c. And laſt of all he was ſeen of me, as one borne out of due time: for I am the leaſt of all the Apoſtles, and am not worthy to be called an Apoſtle.</hi> The Greek word ſignifies a <hi>child</hi> that is borne <hi>dead,</hi> or as it were into the <hi>World, before</hi> the time. We ſay ſomtimes of a child when it is borne there is the <hi>leaſt</hi> child that ever was borne <hi>alive;</hi> but yet it was borne <hi>alive</hi> and in <hi>ſeaſon:</hi> but an <hi>abortive</hi> is a child that is borne by <hi>miſcarriage,</hi> that is borne <hi>dead,</hi> it is leſſe then the <hi>leaſt</hi> child, and leſſe eſteemed. <hi>Job</hi> ſayth, <hi>O that I had been an abortive, that my mother had buried me in ſecret? Paul</hi> could not compare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the <hi>leaſt</hi> Saint; but as it were to an <hi>abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> to a thing not worth the mentioning among the <hi>living,</hi> I am an <hi>abortive</hi> ſayth he, not becauſe of the time that I did come after them; though it be true that <hi>Paul</hi> was made an Apoſtle after the reſt: but ſayth he, <hi>I am the leaſt of all Saints;</hi> this was the reaſon.</p>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:53448:98"/>
                     <p>Take but one place more. <hi>Epheſ. 3. 8. Unto me, who am leſſe then the leaſt of all Saints is this grace gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable riches of Chriſt. To me that am leſſe then the leaſt.</hi> The meaning of it is, for in the Greek language, in which the Apoſtles wrote; they have ſix degrees of compariſon; now in Engliſh, and in ſome other tongues there are but three, as we ſay, <hi>good, better,</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> of all; we goe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: a thing is <hi>little,</hi> and <hi>leſſe,</hi> and <hi>leaſt</hi> of all. But they double it again, and they ſay, <hi>little,</hi> and <hi>leſſe,</hi> and <hi>leaſt;</hi> and a thing <hi>leſſe</hi> then the <hi>leaſt,</hi> and more <hi>little,</hi> and <hi>leſſe</hi> then the <hi>leaſt</hi> of all. Paul choſe to goe to the loweſt pin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>leſſe then the leaſt Saint. Minor minimo, leſſe</hi> then the <hi>leaſt.</hi> As if he had ſayd, ſuppoſe we gather together all the tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered broken <hi>profeſſors</hi> in the World, that walke <hi>diſhonourably</hi> to God, the <hi>blind,</hi> and the <hi>lame,</hi> (as it were) that doe <hi>leaſt</hi> reſemble him: yet let them be but <hi>Saints,</hi> though the <hi>blindeſt,</hi> and <hi>looſeſt,</hi> and <hi>fooliſheſt,</hi> and <hi>giddieſt profeſſors,</hi> put <hi>them</hi> all in a company, and put <hi>me</hi> in the middeſt, and I am <hi>leſse</hi> then the <hi>leaſt</hi> of them. Canſt thou ſay ſo, and thinke ſo, when thou walkeſt in the ſtreet, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when thou art in the congregation of Saints, <hi>I am leſſe then the leaſt?</hi> The Apoſtle Paul could ſay ſo. That now is one thing, that is this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell grace, Goſpell humilitie to think ſo.</p>
                     <p>Not but that man (underſtand me) may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <note place="margin">1. Though God have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on him.</note> that there is <hi>more grace</hi> ſhewed to him, then to all the <hi>World</hi> beſides.

                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:53448:98"/> ſuffering, God hath <hi>borne</hi> more with <hi>me,</hi> and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered longer, then with <hi>any</hi> Saint that I know. This is not contrary to the grace of humiliation: for this <hi>Paul</hi> that ſaid he was the <hi>leaſt of Saints,</hi> in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. He ſayth that he had received <hi>more</hi> mercy then any other, and that he was made a <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne</hi> to all that ſhould beleive, not of any <hi>good</hi> in <hi>him;</hi> but of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>mercie</hi> beſtowed on him from <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, a man may goe further, and yet be a <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. And may doe more ſervice for God.</note> hearted Chriſtian. He may ſay, as I have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> more favours from God then others, ſo God hath carried me on to <hi>doe</hi> more then many others, <hi>I am leſſe then the leaſt of them</hi> ſayth Paul, <hi>yet I laboured more abundantly then they all.</hi> That was no pride in him, <hi>I am leſſe then the leaſt,</hi> yet I Preached the Goſpell from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Illiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum;</hi> but <hi>not I, but the grace of God.</hi> That is the goodneſſe of God that carries us on, if any man be <hi>carried</hi> on to a good worke, and God <hi>bleſſeth</hi> it, let him looke on it when he hath done, and he will ſay he was <hi>paſsive</hi> in it, and was carried on by <hi>grace.</hi> Now take thoſe two <hi>cautions,</hi> and then a <hi>humble</hi> hearted <hi>Saint</hi> will ſay, put me into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of <hi>broken</hi> profeſſors, and I am <hi>leſſe</hi> then the <hi>leaſt,</hi> and the raggedeſt of them.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, how can that be that a Saint <note place="margin">A humble Saint judgeth himſelfe the leaſt.</note> ſhould be taught in the communion of Saints, ſhould ſo conceive of himſelfe, it ſeemes impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible?</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And others it may be, may think thus in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect <note place="margin">2.

This is one way whereby you may know whether you be rightly <hi>humbled</hi> by your carriage to the Saints, if you look on your ſelves as the very <hi>leaſt</hi> of Saints.</p>

This you have <hi>Rom. 12.

                     <p>O, the pride, and the wretchedneſſe of ſome that are ready to ſay, what doe I <hi>care</hi> what all the <hi>World</hi> thinks; all the World <hi>now,</hi> or they that were <hi>before;</hi> and it may be it is but a <hi>conceit</hi> of <hi>yeſterday,</hi> or it may be it is a <hi>truth:</hi> but it argueth a vile, <hi>proud</hi> heart. Shall I ſay what doe I care what <hi>others</hi> think? why ſhould I be perſwaded that I am ſo <hi>ſainted,</hi> that I ſhould not <hi>care</hi> what the Generation of the <hi>Saints</hi> that are <hi>otherwiſe</hi> minded ſay. There are many things in our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we may have full <hi>aſſurance</hi> of: but there may be full <hi>aſſurance</hi> of underſtanding concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53448:101"/> truths, that a man may preach with <hi>boldneſſe,</hi> and <hi>ſuffer,</hi> and <hi>die</hi> for it with fearleſneſſe, and yet there may be a kind of <hi>jealouſie</hi> in the ſoul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, when the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> that he looks on as <hi>above</hi> him, are of another mind.

Say they, let us not be too <hi>violent</hi> againſt <hi>Paul, Who knoweth but that an Angel hath revealed this to him.</hi> So a <hi>humble</hi> heart thinks, this is the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and I dare <hi>die</hi> for it: but this is the time of <hi>pouring out of the ſpirit;</hi> and ſuch men as are <hi>above</hi> me, they are of <hi>another</hi> mind, and how doe I know, but <hi>God</hi> may be in it? So there is a holy <hi>ſuſpicion,</hi> (that yet hinders not full <hi>aſſurance)</hi> that riſeth meerly out of <hi>reverence,</hi> and <hi>reſpect</hi> of all the <hi>Saints</hi> that he ſees, and thinks are <hi>above</hi> him.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we have <hi>proud</hi> ſpirits; a <hi>devillſh</hi> ſpirit of <hi>pride</hi> among <hi>us,</hi> when a man ſhall <hi>conceit</hi> that he only is in the <hi>right,</hi> and <hi>ſlight</hi> others.

                     <p>Fourthly, from this (for they depend one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another) you may know a humble heart in his demeanour to the Saints; he is very <hi>meek,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">4.

                     <p>Eightly, you ſhall know a <hi>humble</hi> heart by his <note place="margin">8.

                     <p>He is not diſcouraged in grace by the ſight of greater grace in others. Indeed he is <hi>humbled</hi> that others are more <hi>watchfull,</hi> and <hi>tender</hi> and live <hi>more</hi> to <hi>God:</hi> but yet he is not <hi>diſcouraged.</hi> There are ſome (but it is the <hi>pride</hi> of their hearts) when they looke one others that are <hi>greater</hi> in <hi>grace;</hi> (they are as a <hi>weake</hi> ſight that looks on the <hi>ſun,</hi> then they can ſee <hi>nothing)</hi> there is nothing but <hi>mopeing,</hi> and <hi>louring,</hi> whereas they ſhould goe ſweetly, and <hi>humble</hi> themſelves: ſuch a one hath <hi>more</hi> grace, but it may be I have had as much <hi>time,</hi> and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>ſtirrings</hi> up of the <hi>people</hi> of God, and yet what a <hi>poore, low</hi> creature am I?</p>

It is called <hi>bitterneſſe.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle may allude to a <hi>feaver,</hi> when people are in a <hi>feaver</hi> there is a <hi>bitterneſſe</hi> on the <hi>tongue,</hi> the man can take <hi>nothing</hi> in while he is in that diſpoſition he is <hi>angrie</hi> with <hi>every</hi> thing, his <hi>wife</hi> and his <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> cannot ſpeake to him. VVhat is the reaſon?

                        <note place="margin">10. He is carefull not to offend other Saints.</note> with others (for I might ſpeake much of that) ſo he is carefull of <hi>avoyding</hi> the leaſt <hi>offence</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Indeed a <hi>humble</hi> heart, you cannot eaſily <hi>provoke</hi> him.

                     <p>Firſt, he will if need be, <hi>abate</hi> much of his <hi>light</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 In abating of his own light.</note> in his <hi>practice,</hi> for <hi>offence</hi> ſake. There is a leſſon for theſe times.

                     </p>

                     <p>A <hi>proud</hi> heart is <hi>glad,</hi> and <hi>joyfull</hi> of any new <hi>nik,</hi> or <hi>notion</hi> whereby he may <hi>provoke</hi> the Saints: I know diverſe ſuch, that live upon <hi>found</hi> conceits, as <hi>Taylors</hi> invent new <hi>faſhions,</hi> and though they <hi>provoke</hi> the <hi>generalitie</hi> of other <hi>Saints,</hi> yet it muſt out every weeke or fortnight: it is not ſo with a <hi>humble</hi> heart, he will <hi>ſee two ſteps</hi> before he will <hi>tread one</hi> (as we ſay in VVales) and when he ſees it, and muſt goe a <hi>ſtep</hi> that <hi>croſſeth</hi> the light, and ſpirit of the <hi>Saints,</hi> it makes his heart ake, though he muſt obey God.</p>

We read how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe did Propheſie in the Campe, and they come to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and deſire him to forbid them, O ſay they, looke yonder, he is turned <hi>Preacher</hi> now.

                     <p>Another thing, which I ſpake of before, is, that <note place="margin">14. He can love though he be not loved.</note>

The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth anſwer an objection. For they might ſay, what then ſhall we doe with the <hi>law</hi> if it cannot <hi>juſtifie</hi> us? There the Apoſtle tells us that though the <hi>law</hi> cannot <hi>juſtifie</hi> us, yet there are many bleſſed uſes, both for <hi>ſinners,</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> to make of the <hi>law,</hi> of which I ſhall not now ſpeake.</p>
                     <p>Now in this 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter the Apoſtle drawes this concluſion from what he had ſaid before. <hi>There is therefore</hi> (from what I have ſayd) it is
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53448:110"/> evident that there is <hi>no condemnation,</hi> there is no <hi>damnation,</hi> there is no <hi>danger</hi> of hell <hi>to them which are in Christ Jeſus.</hi> Now he opens who thoſe are, he ſayth they are thoſe <hi>Who walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> And he gives a reaſon of it in Verſ. 2. why there is no damnation to thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>For the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made us free from the law of ſin and of death.</hi> Now he amplifies that in Verſ. 3. <hi>For what the law could not doe in that it was weake through the fleſh, God ſending his owne ſon in the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſayd: thus it comes about that we are now <hi>free</hi> from the <hi>law,</hi> and that there is no <hi>damnation</hi> to us, becauſe ſayth he, that God hath ſent his ſon in the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh, like one of us, and he hath <hi>fulfilled</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſin; therefore there is no <hi>ſin</hi> to <hi>condemne</hi> us, nor no jot of the <hi>law</hi> that is not <hi>fullfilled:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are juſt, and righteous, and cleare. <hi>There is no condemnatiom to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> For God hath ſent his ſon to condemne ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>There are in the words two things.</p>
                     <p>Here is a great <hi>priviledge</hi> as any can be, to have the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> fullfilled in us.</p>
                     <p>And here are ſecondly the parties that have the benefit of this priviledge <hi>Thoſe that walke not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh but after the ſpirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the priviledge, to underſtand the words a little. <hi>That the righteouſneſſe of the law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> That the <hi>law</hi> might be fully <hi>ſatisfyed</hi> in poynt of <hi>righteouſneſſe:</hi> that the <hi>law</hi> might have ſuch a righteouſneſſe, which indeed the law requires, that it might have a <hi>full,</hi> and compleat righteouſneſſe in us. So that breifly theſe are the leſſons which I ſhall open from hence, which I deſire that our ſouls may feed upon.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that
<q>
                           <p>The law requires of every man a righteouſneſſe to fulfill it.</p>
                        </q> Or that
<q>
                           <p>Every man is bound to get him a righteouſneſse to fulfill the law of God.</p>
                        </q>

                        <hi>Every</hi> man is bound to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God. That is one thing.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond leſſon will be this, that
<q>
                           <p>The law is perfectly fulfilled or ſatiſfied in all true beleivers,</p>

                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:53448:111"/>
                     <p>I ſay firſt,
<q>
                           <p>The law requireth a righteouſneſſe from every <note place="margin">

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or, <hi>Every man is bound to fulfill the law of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That is the firſt thing. The grounds of that are theſe, I ſhall but touch them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe that <hi>God</hi> made man, man was his <hi>creature,</hi> and the Lord was his <hi>ſoveraigne:</hi> and <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From Gods ſoveraignty.</note> when God made all Creatures, you know hee made <hi>Lawes</hi> for them; hee made a <hi>Law</hi> for the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> and <hi>Starres,</hi> &amp;c. and every thing goes according to the <hi>law</hi> that God determined for it. Now when God made man, (who was but his creature though he were a more excellent creature) he made a <hi>law</hi> for him, this bleſſed <hi>law</hi> of God which is in his booke here, the Covenant of <hi>works</hi> as it was ſometimes called: therefore as all other <hi>creatures</hi> were bound to goe in their courſe, and keep their peculiar <hi>laws</hi> that God layd on them, ſo man alſo was bound to keepe the <hi>law</hi> of God that God made for him.</p>
                     <p>Another thing is this, that beſides the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie <note place="margin">2. From mans covenant with God.</note> of God, that might impoſe a law upon him; there was ſecondly a <hi>compact</hi> between God, and man, and ſo there was a kind of <hi>bargaine:</hi> for God layd that law upon man, and <hi>Adam</hi> as a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> perſon he undertooke to keepe that law by a <hi>contract,</hi> or <hi>bargaine.</hi> If God (as it were) had had no right before to lay it on him, yet now man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke it, by way of <hi>bargaine</hi> to keep the law of God. <hi>Adam</hi> firſt did it, and might have done it: and afterwards the people of Iſraell profeſſe to doe it. <hi>All theſe words we will doe;</hi> we will keepe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53448:111"/> them. That is another reaſon whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that <hi>every</hi> man, and woman in the World is bound to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, another thing is this, if you conſider <note place="margin">3. Nothing can exempt man from it.</note> what there is that might <hi>free</hi> a man from <hi>keeping</hi> a <hi>law</hi> that is layd upon him, you ſhall ſee that there are none of thoſe things that can help him in this. As</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, our <hi>laws</hi> many times are <hi>repealed;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. It is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</note> and that law that a man was bound to keepe a few yeares agoe, he is bound to proteſt againſt now, as the <hi>Service-booke,</hi> the <hi>common prayer, &amp;c.</hi> There is that penaltie now for <hi>uſing</hi> it, as there was for <hi>not</hi> uſing it a few yeares ſince: now it is not ſo with the law of God. <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſſe away, but one jot or tittle of the law ſhall not paſſe.</hi> That law is an eternall law, there is no repealing of it.</p>
                     <p>Then Secondly, you know <hi>Judges,</hi> and <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. The Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cannot be bribed.</note> among men, may be <hi>corrupted,</hi> and <hi>bribed,</hi> and may be brought to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with their <hi>owne</hi> laws, nay ſometimes to goe <hi>againſt</hi> their owne <hi>laws:</hi> but God is a juſt God. and when his owne ſon, the ſon of his love did take upon him to be borne <hi>under the law,</hi> and to be a <hi>ſuretie</hi> for man, he endured the ſmart of the <hi>law,</hi> and was dealt with, as if he had been another.</p>
                     <p>Then there is no <hi>evaſion,</hi> or <hi>eſcaping:</hi> among <note place="margin">3. There is no eſcaping.</note> men there is. If a man breake the law, and goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>another Countrie,</hi> he is cleare, and <hi>free:</hi> but here is no <hi>eſcaping,</hi> one cannot goe away. <hi>VVhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I goe from thy preſence,</hi> ſayth David, <hi>where</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 139.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhall I hide my ſelfe from thee?</hi> A man can goe no where but the law of God will be on him. So that
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53448:112"/> 
                        <hi>every</hi> man, and woman in the World are ſtill <hi>bound</hi> to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> law of God, or to get a <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> a <hi>perfect</hi> righteouſneſſe to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>Now there are but three wayes in the World <note place="margin">3. Wayes to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the law.</note> to fulfill the law of God.</p>
                     <p>Eyther a man muſt doe it in his <hi>owne perſon,</hi> as <note place="margin">1. In a mans owne perſon.</note> moſt men doe, (beſides <hi>Papiſts)</hi> more or leſſe; they will goe and doe their <hi>beſt,</hi> and doe the <hi>good,</hi> leave the <hi>evill,</hi> and performe <hi>duties;</hi> and they think by their doing to keepe the law.</p>
                     <p>Or elſe ſecondly, by <hi>ſuffering,</hi> that is, partly in <note place="margin">2. By ſuffering.</note> 
                        <hi>this</hi> World; and afterwards in <hi>Hel:</hi> for that is the buſineſſe of <hi>Hell,</hi> for <hi>Hell</hi> is nothing but the place where people are <hi>fulfilling</hi> the law of God. What doth <hi>Caine,</hi> and other wretches doing in hell? They are <hi>paying</hi> the <hi>debt, fulfilling</hi> the law of God to <hi>eternity</hi> by <hi>ſuffering,</hi> becauſe they did not full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill it by <hi>doing</hi> while they were here. That is the reaſon that they are in Hell for <hi>ever,</hi> becauſe they can <hi>never</hi> pay the <hi>debt,</hi> therefore they muſt abide there for <hi>ever:</hi> for if it could be ſuppoſed that they could give a compleat <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> that might <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the law they ſhould ſtay in Priſon no longer, they ſhould be in Hell no more.</p>
                     <p>Then thirdly, there is another glorious way, <note place="margin">3. By Jeſus Chriſt.</note> that is, in <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt he hath <hi>kept</hi> the <hi>law,</hi> and <hi>perfectly</hi> fulfilled it, now a man by <hi>beleiving</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, and by being <hi>unyted</hi> to him, and <hi>married</hi> to him, that in his <hi>owne</hi> perſon hath <hi>fulfilled</hi> the law, being married to him, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he hath, is yours, and whatſoever <hi>he</hi> hath done, it is as if it had been done by <hi>you,</hi> all ſhall be <hi>imputed</hi> to you, and ſo the law of God may be <hi>full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi>
                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:53448:112"/> in <hi>you</hi> perfectly and you ſhall never goe to <hi>Hell,</hi> and have nothing to doe, or to ſuffer in that kind. This being premiſed breifly: the uſe of this may be twofold.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to ſhew you what a <hi>vaine,</hi> and <hi>fooliſh</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> The vanity of thoſe that goe about to keepe the law.</note> thing it is for a man to goe about to <hi>keepe</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God in his <hi>owne</hi> ſtrength or in his <hi>owne</hi> perſon: for you to think to <hi>ſave</hi> your <hi>ſoules,</hi> or to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> by your owne doings: Beloved it is a great matter to bring poore <hi>ſinners</hi> to be <hi>awakened,</hi> to <hi>ſee</hi> their ſins, or to break off their courſe in ſin. For there are many <hi>drunkards,</hi> and <hi>ſwearers,</hi> and <hi>jearers</hi> of Religion, and <hi>prophaners</hi> of the <hi>Lords</hi> day that ſit as <hi>ſots</hi> all the yeare and are never <hi>awakned:</hi> but generally when men are <hi>awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Sinners awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened labour to fullfill the law.</note> out of their <hi>ſins</hi> this is the <hi>reſolution</hi> of all man kind, of every man, none excepted, unleſſe God have mercy on him; he is ready to ſay, I ſee I am in a <hi>damnable</hi> way, and this courſe will bring me to <hi>hell,</hi> by the grace of God I will turne over a new leafe, and now I will heare <hi>Sermons,</hi> I was wont to <hi>jeare</hi> at them, and I will get me a practice of piety or ſome other good Book, and I will have <hi>prayers</hi> in my houſe, and I will be <hi>drunke</hi> no more, and <hi>ſweare</hi> no more; I will be a new man, I will <hi>avoyd</hi> that which is <hi>evill,</hi> and <hi>doe</hi> that which is <hi>good.</hi> And marke it, this is more naturall to man then ſin: it is more <hi>naturall</hi> to man to be <hi>righteous</hi> then to be <hi>ſinfull:</hi> becauſe he was righteous <hi>before</hi> he was ſinfull. The liquor that is put <hi>firſt</hi> into a veſſell, the veſſell keeps the <hi>taſt</hi> of that longer then of any that is put into it afterwards. Now God at <hi>firſt</hi> made man <hi>righteous,</hi> and man is more apt to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53448:113"/> fall to that kind of righteouſneſſe, then to any ſin. And this is the great <hi>miſery</hi> of people, every one in ſome faſhion or other, this is his <hi>buſineſſe</hi> he goes about to <hi>fulfill</hi> the law of God in his <hi>owne</hi> perſon: and there you ſhall have one <hi>praying,</hi> and another <hi>crying,</hi> and another keeping ſo many <hi>faſts,</hi> and dayes of <hi>humiliation</hi> upon humiliation: and the end of all is, if men had eyes to ſee it, his endeavour is to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to <hi>ſcrape,</hi> and to get up a <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> to <hi>pay</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>You cannot conceive, and comprehend how ſubject you, and I, are to this miſery; and how this is in your very bones (as it were) and I feare truly it is the greateſt part of your <hi>Religion,</hi> and the moſt of your <hi>profeſsion</hi> is nothing but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to get a <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God, though ſome doe it in a <hi>cloſer,</hi> ſiner way then others.</p>
                     <p>Now I beſeech you conſider this word, lay <note place="margin">No man can fulfill the law by doing.</note> downe this throughly in your hearts, that it is a <hi>vaine</hi> thing ſo to doe, and who would goe about a vaine thing, a thing that he ſhall never bring to <hi>perfection?</hi> For it is not every <hi>paltrie</hi> righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that can <hi>fulfill</hi> the law of God. It is not ten thouſand <hi>faſtings</hi> that can fullfill the law of God; it is not <hi>praying</hi> in your familie three times a day that can fullfill the law. I ſpeake not againſt theſe things in their right way, and courſe: but all will not doe in this reſpect; for if you faile but <hi>once,</hi> if you miſs but one farthing you are gone, if you have but <hi>one</hi> bad <hi>thought</hi> in all your life you are loſt.

Therefore who would be ſo <hi>mad</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Gallathians mad Gallathians; <hi>VVho hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched you?)</hi> It is a kind of <hi>madneſſe</hi> for any man to attempt in his <hi>owne</hi> perſon, by <hi>doing,</hi> or <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to <hi>fulfill</hi> the righteouſneſſe of the <hi>law,</hi> or to <hi>juſtifie,</hi> and <hi>ſave</hi> his <hi>ſoul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You will ſay, we grant it is true, and therefore <note place="margin">Many ſeek to be juſtified by works beſides Papiſts.</note> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are much to blame, that labour to be <hi>juſtified</hi> by their works. They are ſo, and ſo are

It is a thing that ſticks nearer to you then you are aware of: though it may be at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you ſee <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>juſtification</hi> by him clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet at other times you know how many <hi>pangs,</hi> and how may ſecret <hi>glances</hi> we have at our <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> by our <hi>owne</hi> works: take notice of the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of this. That is one word.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, me thinks this ſhould move you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <note place="margin">
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. It ſhould move us to come to Chriſt,</note> all things in the World if it were conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and O that the Lord would be pleaſed yet to open your eyes while it is called to day: I ſay this ſhould be one of the greateſt <hi>motives</hi> in the World to <hi>come</hi> to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>get</hi> into Chriſt; to <hi>receive</hi> Jeſus Chriſt and in <hi>him</hi> (as I ſhall ſhew after) you ſhall have a <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> that hath <hi>fulfilled</hi> the <hi>law.</hi> Let every man ſay, I ſee here is a <hi>law</hi> that God hath layd upon me, I am ſubject to it, and this law muſt be <hi>fulfilled,</hi> there is no helpe for it, <hi>every</hi> man is bound to it, he muſt have a <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> to ſatisfie the <hi>law,</hi> Heaven, and Earth ſhal paſſe away rather then that ſhal not be. Now there are but three ways to fulfil it: either in mine <hi>owne</hi> perſon here: or to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for ever in hell: or elſe to <hi>beleive</hi> in, and <hi>receive</hi> another that may doe it for me. Now we neyther by our <hi>doing,</hi> or <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> can get ſuch a <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> that is cleare: therefore there is but <hi>one</hi> way, that is, in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> there is a <hi>perfect</hi> righteouſneſſe in him, he hath <hi>fulfilled</hi> the <hi>law;</hi> get into him, and be <hi>one</hi> with
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53448:114"/> him, and then we ſhall be able to ſay perfectly with Paul, <hi>That the righteouſneſſe of the law might be fulfilled in us that beleive,</hi> and are in Jeſus Chriſt.

                        <note place="margin">The weakeſt Saint in Chriſt hath ſatisfied the Law.</note> is perfectly <hi>fulfilled.</hi> The <hi>weakeſt</hi> Saint, if he be a <hi>true</hi> Saint, he hath <hi>perfectly</hi> fulfilled the <hi>law</hi> of God, he hath perfectly ſatisfied every <hi>demand</hi> that the law can make; he hath perfectly <hi>paid</hi> every penny worth of debt that he oweth to the law, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Saint, it may be a <hi>poore</hi> Saint that men can ſee nothing but <hi>corruption</hi> in all the <hi>day,</hi> and all the <hi>weeke,</hi> and all the <hi>yeare</hi> long almoſt, yet that man, if he be a <hi>true</hi> Saint, though he be <hi>weak,</hi> hath <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> kept the <hi>law</hi> of God, and is a juſt man, and the <hi>law</hi> of God cannot come upon him,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53448:119"/> nor the <hi>Sergeant</hi> the Devill to <hi>arreſt</hi> him for one <hi>penny</hi> or farthing, becauſe he can ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here; <hi>The righteouſneſſe of the law is fulfilled in us.</hi> Therefore that is the reaſon, as I told you, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am dead to the law,</hi> that is, I am as <hi>free</hi> from the law as a man that is <hi>dead:</hi> when a man is <hi>dead</hi> the <hi>law</hi> goes no <hi>further</hi> on him. So it is ſaid we are <hi>delivered</hi> from the law, and <hi>freed</hi> from the <hi>law.</hi> And that is the reaſon alſo that the Apoſtle <note place="margin">In Chriſt we are ſaved by Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe as well as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> three times in one Chapter puts our ſalvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of God; he ſaith not by the <hi>mercie</hi> of God, though that be true, there is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>mercie,</hi> but ſaith he, that God might <hi>declare his righteouſneſſe</hi> in Chriſt to ſave us. It is a <hi>mercifull</hi> thing for God to <hi>give</hi> us <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to give us <hi>hearts</hi> to <hi>know</hi> that Chriſt, and to <hi>believe</hi> in that Chriſt, it is infinite unſpeakable <hi>mercie.</hi> But now that wee are in Chriſt, and united to him; as there was <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> ſo it is <hi>righteous,</hi> and juſt with God to ſave us, becauſe we are <hi>righteous</hi> perſons. Miſtake me not, I ſay, <hi>every</hi> poore Saint <hi>through Chriſt</hi> is a <hi>righteous</hi> perſon, a <hi>just</hi> man. I ſay in and through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he hath taken away all our <hi>ſins,</hi> and forgiven all our <hi>iniquities,</hi> Coll. 2. So that when God <hi>ſaves</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, he doth not only <hi>ſave</hi> them out of <hi>mercie,</hi> but out of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> he can doe no otherwiſe: therefore it is three times over, <hi>his righteouſneſs, his righteouſneſs, his righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 3. And that is a bleſſed word in <hi>Heb. 12. Yee are come to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> I doe not conceive that it is ſpoken of the ſpirits of men in <hi>heaven,</hi> as many doe, and no wonder they miſtake: for I did ſo for many yeares. That place it looks ſo like <hi>heaven,</hi>
                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:53448:120"/> that I tooke it for heaven it ſelf; <hi>Yee are come unto mount Sion, to the generall aſſembly, and Church of the firſt borne, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> A man would think it were <hi>heaven</hi> it ſelf: it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>heaven,</hi> but it is nothing in the world but the glorious eſtate of the <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> under the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> as you may ſee afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Therefore as Chriſt ſaith, let this word ſink into your hearts, that if thou be a right believer, thou art as <hi>perfectly juſt</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> through Jeſus Chriſt, as if thou hadſt never <hi>ſinned</hi> againſt the <hi>law</hi> of God: not by thy <hi>own</hi> righteouſneſſe, but by the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For what can be ſaid more? ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled.</hi> He doth not ſay we have a peice of it, but it is <hi>fulfilled,</hi> that is, to a <hi>jote,</hi> or <hi>tittle;</hi> the law cannot ſay, <hi>black is thine eye,</hi> becauſe Chriſt hath paid and done all that it can demand.</p>
                     <p>Now to give you a word or two of the grounds, or reaſons, to help you to believe this truth, to ſhew you how it comes about. It comes about three wayes, I meane it will be cleare to you three wayes, if you conſider three things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, You muſt conſider that Jeſus Chriſt, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Chriſt a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like perſon.</note> which is our ſuretie, he was ſent of the Father, out of his love as a publike perſon to fulfill the law of God, by doing and ſuffering as a <hi>publike</hi> perſon. There is much comfort in that. Beloved, you can never throughly underſtand your juſtification, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you ſtudy the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> what kind of perſon <hi>Adam</hi> was, as you may ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Now the Lord Jeſus, he came as a <hi>publike</hi> perſon, and <hi>he was delivered for our offences,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Rom. 3. ult.</hi>
                        <pb n="227" facs="tcp:53448:120"/> he did die for our ſinnes. That is one thing.</p>
                     <p>Now the ſecond thing that demonſtrates this to <note place="margin">2. From the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between Chriſt and believers.</note> us, is beſides his <hi>dying,</hi> and that as a <hi>publike</hi> perſon, there is a <hi>union</hi> made between every poore <hi>believer</hi> and Chriſt, as really as between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Indeed it is called in Scripture a <hi>marriage;</hi> becauſe as in a marriage all the <hi>wealth</hi> of the <hi>huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> is the <hi>wives,</hi> it becomes hers, and ſhee hath a <hi>right</hi> to it after marriage: So all that is in <hi>Chriſt</hi> becomes <hi>ours</hi> by this <hi>union.</hi> But it is a more <hi>reall</hi> union, a <hi>cloſer</hi> union by far then that of marriage: it is compared to the union between the <hi>members</hi> and the <hi>head.</hi> Now by this union, that you may read of in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. all that is <hi>ours</hi> becomes <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and all that is <hi>Chriſts</hi> becomes <hi>ours.</hi> There are two things.</p>
                     <p>Then thirdly, we finde that God the <hi>father,</hi> to <note place="margin">3. God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, which appeares</note> whom the debt was owing, and whoſe law this was that we muſt ſatisfie, he acknowledgeth <hi>ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And what can we have more? God the <hi>father</hi> acknowledgeth that his <hi>Son</hi> hath <hi>ſatisfied</hi> the <hi>law,</hi> and therefore we are freed. Now he doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it three wayes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, You ſhall have it <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. compared with <note place="margin">1. by Gods own teſtimonie.</note> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. For <hi>Peter</hi> is much in it, <hi>we follow not devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fables,</hi> but we come to ſpeake of the voyce in the Mount, <hi>This is my beloved Son.</hi> As if he had ſaid, This is one maine peice of the Goſpel, we heard a voyce when we were with our Maſter in the mount, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom my ſoule is well pleaſed.</hi> That for his perſon.</p>
                     <p>Then a ſecond thing that did ſhew that he was <note place="margin">2. Chriſt is out of priſon.</note> 
                        <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> was by ſuffering Jeſus Chriſt after he was
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53448:121"/> 
                        <hi>arreſted,</hi> and in <hi>priſon</hi> for our debt (for Chriſt was in priſon for our debt; he was arreſted, and that according to law, he was brought into priſon, and all our ſuits were clapped on his back; all our <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions</hi> and <hi>outlaries</hi> were layd on his ſhoulders, and then the Father let him <hi>out</hi> of <hi>priſon</hi> being our ſuretie. If he had not payd our debt, he had not come out of priſon, but) now the Father lets him <hi>out,</hi> that is, the Father ſuffred him to <hi>riſe</hi> from the <hi>dead.</hi> Therefore we finde that our <hi>juſtification</hi> is layd more upon the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, then upon his <hi>death;</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Rom. 4. 25. Who was delivered for our offences, and raiſed againe for our juſtification;</hi> that is, he did <hi>die</hi> for our <hi>ſins,</hi> and was <hi>raiſed</hi> againe for our <hi>juſtification.</hi> And in <hi>Rom. 8. He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him give us all things? Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſsion for us.</hi> That is, his <hi>dying</hi> for us did <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the <hi>law,</hi> but that did not <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie</hi> us, untill we ſee that he was <hi>riſen</hi> againe; and then we ſee that all the <hi>debt</hi> was paid, becauſe our <hi>ſuretie</hi> is gotten <hi>out</hi> of <hi>priſon.</hi> Therefore <hi>juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (I meane the knowledge of it at leaſt) princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ariſeth from Chriſts <hi>reſurrection.</hi> Now when I ſee Chriſt is <hi>riſen,</hi> and is gone <hi>abroad,</hi> he is gone out of the <hi>grave,</hi> and gone to <hi>heaven,</hi> I know that the <hi>law</hi> is <hi>fulfilled,</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> is <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> and the <hi>Sergeant</hi> the <hi>Devill</hi> hath nothing to arreſt me for, all is <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> all is cleare.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, I know God the <hi>Father</hi> is <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3 Chriſt is gone into heaven.</note> for the <hi>law</hi> it is God the Fathers <hi>Writt</hi> that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53448:121"/> he had againſt us; and now we ſee that all is payd, not onely becauſe our ſuretie is got <hi>out</hi> of <hi>priſon;</hi> (for ſo a man may doe that hath not paid a debt) but becauſe when he was out of priſon, he <hi>aſcended</hi> to his <hi>Father;</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> made him ſit at the <hi>right hand</hi> of God in the glory of Majeſty on high, and he hath given him <hi>power,</hi> and authoritie to <hi>rule</hi> the <hi>world</hi> till the day of <hi>Judgement.</hi> Now in that the <hi>Father</hi> hath given the <hi>Son</hi> that <hi>honour</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in <hi>heaven,</hi> as to come and <hi>ſit</hi> at his <hi>right hand;</hi> wee may ſee it was not a <hi>breaking</hi> of priſon, but a <hi>reall</hi> paying of the debt, and a <hi>fulfilling</hi> the law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could come there. This may give a little light how the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> is <hi>fulfilled</hi> in us through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p>The firſt uſe we may make of it is this, that you ſhould learne from what I have ſaid, where your <hi>juſtification</hi> doth lie, your <hi>juſtification</hi> doth not lie, or is not built upon any thing that is <hi>in</hi> you, or that is <hi>done</hi> by you, or that you may <hi>hope</hi> to doe hereafter; you are not <hi>juſtified</hi> by your own <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall good,</hi> or <hi>unjuſtified</hi> by your own <hi>perſonall evills,</hi> you are not one jote the <hi>more</hi> juſt when you have done all the <hi>good</hi> you can in the world, and you are not one jote the leſſe juſt when you have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the <hi>weakneſſes,</hi> and fallen into all the <hi>frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> that a Saint can fall into; becauſe your <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is <hi>built</hi> onely upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and upon what he <hi>did,</hi> and <hi>ſuffered;</hi> My <hi>juſtification</hi> is built upon the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt, and his <hi>reſurrection,</hi> he hath <hi>fulfilled</hi>

                     <p>Now you ſhall find that you lay a great part of <note place="margin">Men build ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomething in themſelves.</note> your <hi>juſtification</hi> upon ſomething in your <hi>ſelves,</hi> therefore when you are <hi>enlarged</hi> in <hi>good,</hi> you think you are <hi>more</hi> juſtified; and when you fall into <hi>ſin,</hi> you think you are more <hi>unjuſt</hi> then you were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and you look <hi>ſtrangely</hi> upon God. Now the Lord hath put it out of our hands. <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have been <hi>juſtified,</hi> by that that was in <hi>him,</hi> and that ſhould have been <hi>done</hi> by him: but bleſſed be God, he would not <hi>truſt</hi> us with that good any more, but hath put <hi>all</hi> in the hands of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and there is the whole <hi>foundation</hi> of our <hi>juſtification.</hi> Therefore it is not for a Chriſtian to come, and ſay, O Sir, I feare I am no <hi>childe</hi> of God, I feare I ſhall prove an <hi>hypocrite,</hi> why ſo? becauſe I finde ſo much <hi>ſin,</hi> and ſo many <hi>luſts</hi> in me.

                     <p>Or ſecondly, think of the <hi>rules</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">To look on Chriſts rules.</note> the rules of the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> this bleſſed word: have frequent recourſe to the ſpirituall <hi>rules</hi> of the new Teſtament that ſhould be your <hi>coppy.</hi> When any caſe comes, follow not your luſts, and act not according to the <hi>wiſdome of the fleſh,</hi> to ſay
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53448:128"/> this, or that I will doe, but conſider what is your <hi>rule,</hi> you walke by <hi>another</hi> rule. What have I to doe what <hi>ſuch</hi> a man, and <hi>ſuch</hi> a man doth; but what is my rule? how muſt I carry my ſelfe? As for inſtance; when you come among people <note place="margin">Severall Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell rules.</note> that <hi>rejoyce</hi> for any mercie, what is the rule? <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with them that rejoyce, and weep with them that weep.</hi> It may be a man hath received great <hi>unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> and is <hi>wrong'd</hi> by him that he hath been moſt <hi>kind</hi> to, of all the men in the World; and yet he proves moſt <hi>ungratefull,</hi> if a man ſhould goe to <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> he would <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>abhorr</hi> him, and not indure him; man in his beſt naturalls would not <hi>beare</hi> it; he would not beare <hi>ungratefullneſse,</hi> and <hi>wrong,</hi> but labour to requite it. But what is the <hi>rule? The Lord is good to the wicked and unthank<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full.</hi> Therefore <hi>Lend freely, looking for nothing againe.</hi> Preſently, God will bring a ſpirituall <hi>rule</hi> to your mind, and God will give you <hi>power</hi> to doe it. And ſo, ſuppoſe a man ſhould charge and challenge you with a <hi>debt,</hi> and would have you <hi>pay</hi> ſuch a debt, you perhaps know no ſuch thing, and are perſwaded of the contrary. What now? You know what moſt men think, I will never pay him, I were a <hi>foole</hi> if I ſhould give away my <hi>eſtate,</hi> and be a <hi>Beggar</hi> when I have done: but what is the rule? <hi>If thine enemy ſue thee at the law, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy cloake, give him thy coat alſo.</hi> A Chriſtian comes to this law, he <hi>conſults not with fleſh and blood</hi> when a caſe comes, but he thinks what is the rule in this caſe? But all the miſery is, you will be fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering with juſtification, which you ſhould leave alone upon <hi>Chriſts death, and Reſurrection,</hi> and you
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53448:129"/> ſhould be working out your <hi>holyneſſe</hi> every day, that ſhould be your way, God will bring it in. So when a <hi>woman</hi> is putting on her <hi>cloathes,</hi> and making her fine cloaths, and thinks to be as <hi>fine</hi> as her <hi>Neighbours,</hi> ſhee ſhould think, but what is my <hi>rule?</hi> Not to conforme my ſelfe to others in <hi>embroydred haire,</hi> and fine <hi>apparrell,</hi> and <hi>gold,</hi> but <hi>with the Ornament of a meek ſpirit.</hi> So you have the New Teſtament full: for every caſe there is ſome thing that wil direct and lead you, that thereby you may conforme to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>I give you but generall inſtances, if God open your eyes to ſee your glorious condition in the New Teſtament, you muſt reſolve on this, to <hi>walk</hi> according to the <hi>coppy</hi> and the <hi>rules</hi> of it; that in any caſe you may aske, what is my rule as I am a Chriſtian, as I am a <hi>free</hi> man, one with God, that I may walke by it?</p>
                     <p>Now I exhort you to this, becauſe if a thouſand <note place="margin">The beſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> 
                        <hi>Devills</hi> ſhould preach inſtead of <hi>men,</hi> and tell you what the <hi>Torments</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> are; all would not be ſo great a <hi>motive</hi> by half, to walke <hi>holily,</hi> as to tell you that the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> is <hi>fulfilled</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that you are <hi>righteous,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> &amp; all your <hi>ſins</hi> are done <hi>away</hi> by Chriſt. Therefore, O <hi>love</hi> him, and <hi>live</hi> to him, <hi>conforme</hi> to your <hi>coppy.</hi> Let your <hi>Neighbours</hi> conforme to their <hi>coppy,</hi> to the <hi>World,</hi> and others conforme to their <hi>luſts</hi> (as too many doe) but doe you <hi>conforme</hi> to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> think, what would Chriſt <hi>doe</hi> if he had my <hi>opportunitie?</hi> what would he have taken in <hi>hand?</hi> And what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver occaſion you have with God, or man, aske; what is my <hi>rule</hi> in the New Teſtament, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE were three Leſſons that we may learne from theſe words. The firſt is implied, namely, that
<q>
                           <p>The righteouſneſſe of the law muſt be fulfilled by every man.</p>
                        </q> OR,

                           <p>The law of God is perfectly fulfilled in all true Beleivers.</p>

                     <p>We were the laſt time upon the ſecond; we
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53448:131"/> have prooved it, and opened the poynt, and have made ſome Uſe of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that from hence we may learne where our <hi>juſtification</hi> lieth, and wheron it is <hi>buylt,</hi> not upon any thing <hi>in</hi> us, or done <hi>by</hi> us; but only upon the <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>reſurrection</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, hence all that are <hi>Saints;</hi> all that beleive in Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould labour to ſee the <hi>glorious</hi> condition they are in by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we ſhould learne (being juſtified <hi>freely,</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> by the grace of Jeſus Chriſt) to <hi>conforme</hi> our ſelves in our hearts and lives to the <hi>example</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and to his <hi>rules</hi> in the Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall add but one word more from this Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. True beleivers no Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> that is, that ſeeing the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> is <hi>fulfilled</hi> in them that <hi>beleive;</hi> you may hence ſee that none are further from <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſme.</hi> then thoſe that are true <hi>beleivers,</hi> thoſe that are godly <hi>Saints.</hi> You have a great ſtir con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Antinomians,</hi> what they ſhould be. It <note place="margin">Antinomians, who.</note> is one that is <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>law,</hi> that is the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Greeke word. Now the queſtion is, who is moſt <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God? I doe not denie but that there are ſome, and they may be called <hi>Antinomians</hi> (though we ſhould not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call people) yet they deſerve it. But now a Saint that is in Chriſt he is not an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> he is not <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>law,</hi> becauſe he hath <hi>ſatisfyed</hi> the law. Every man muſt pay the law, and they that would <hi>fulfill</hi> the law with their <hi>owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> they doe the law wrong, they that <hi>doe</hi> moſt here, and they that <hi>ſuffer</hi> moſt in Hell, they can
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53448:131"/> never <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the <hi>law.</hi> But a Chriſtian hath <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> the <hi>law,</hi> becauſe he hath given it a <hi>perfect</hi> righteouſnes. Now if a man ſhould owe <hi>ten</hi> thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, and he had but fifty ſhillings a yeare comming in, and it may be one yeare he payes ten ſhillings, another yeare he payes a Noble, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother yeare three pence, yet he payes as well as he can. But now ſuppoſe there come a <hi>Suretie</hi> and he payes the whole <hi>ten thouſand pound,</hi> and he ſayth to the Creditor you ſhall be paid no more by <hi>three pences,</hi> but you ſhall receive the <hi>whole</hi> ſumme; what doe you think? is not that <hi>better?</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">None ſatisfie the law but beleivers.</note> So there are none that <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the law ſo <hi>roundly,</hi> and <hi>fulfill</hi> it ſo <hi>perfectly,</hi> as he that relinquiſheth all that is in him, and layes hold on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and in him payes God to a farthing. Therfore when <hi>Paul</hi> is prooving ſtrongly that we are <hi>juſtified</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not by the <hi>law,</hi> ſayth he. <hi>We take not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the law, but we eſtabliſh the law.</hi> This is a <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> way of <hi>fulfilling</hi> the law, then any other. All the <hi>damned</hi> men in <hi>Hell,</hi> and all the <hi>Phariſees</hi> on <hi>Earth</hi> cannot <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the <hi>law</hi> ſo well as one poore <hi>ſinner</hi> that <hi>beleives</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo for matter of practice, a man that beleives in Jeſus Chriſt he walks more <hi>ſtrictly</hi> then any <hi>Phariſee</hi> can; for he looks not only what is <hi>lawfull,</hi> but what is <hi>convenyent,</hi> he walks by a more ſublime excellent rule. A <hi>Phariſee</hi> looks only what is <hi>lawfull,</hi> and what is <hi>not</hi> lawfull, but a Chriſtian he looks what is <hi>exact,</hi> and <hi>expedient:</hi> take any man that knows what it is to be <hi>juſtified</hi> by Chriſt, and that man goes a <hi>thouſand</hi> fold further then another, for a man that would be <hi>ſaved</hi> by his owne <hi>fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                        <pb n="250" facs="tcp:53448:132"/> of the <hi>law,</hi> if he cannot come <hi>up</hi> to the law, he will bring the law <hi>downe</hi> to him. As a man that hath a heavie <hi>Burthen,</hi> if it be too heavie for him, he will caſt off <hi>ſome</hi> of it: ſo when a man goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to keep the <hi>law,</hi> and finds it too <hi>heavie</hi> for him, he will throw away <hi>ſome,</hi> and cut out a <hi>part,</hi> and make a <hi>carnall,</hi> groſs law, and endeavour to keep that. Now a man that is <hi>juſtified</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he knowes that the <hi>law</hi> muſt be <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> and ſo he takes it in the <hi>pureſt</hi> ſpiritualitie, and goes to Chriſt Jeſus, and he hath ſatisfied all. So much breifly for the ſecond leſſon.</p>
                     <p>Now I ſhall enter a little upon the third, as ſat as the Lord ſhal give ſtrength &amp; time. Thoſe that beleive, and have this great priviledg which is the Foundation of all others, to have the law <hi>perfectly</hi> fulfilled for them in Chriſt they are here deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to be ſuch, as <hi>walke not according to the fleſh, but according to the ſpirit.</hi> So in the third place take this doctrine, or leſſon: that,
<q>
                           <p>They, and they only that walk not according <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. They only that have Chriſt to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the law for them walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpirit.</note> to the fleſh, but according to the ſpirit, are partakers of this priviledg, to have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to fulfill the law of God for them.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſay <hi>they,</hi> and they only have it, for it excludes all other. The Scripture doth not only ſet it downe poſitively, as it ſayth, <hi>Goe, baptize all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> therfore we may conclude thence that we may baptize thoſe that are <hi>Diſciples:</hi> but from that place to gather this doctrine, that <hi>they,</hi> and they <hi>only</hi> are to be baptized cannot be right:
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53448:132"/> but here I ſay, it is <hi>they,</hi> and they <hi>only.</hi> Why ſo? Becauſe we ſee after, <hi>thoſe that walke according to the fleſh ſhall die,</hi> the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> is not <hi>fulfilled</hi> for them, for then they ſhould never die, nor be damned. They that <hi>walke</hi> after the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and they only have this priviledg. Now the maine buſineſſe that I ſhall endeavour at this time, will be onely to open to you theſe two words.</p>
                     <p>What it is to <hi>walke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And what is meant by <hi>fleſh,</hi> and what by <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For if we underſtand what it is to walke acord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> we ſhall eaſily underſtand what it is to walk according to the <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the former word, to <hi>walk,</hi> I ſhall <note place="margin">To walk, what.</note> ſay but little, becauſe you underſtand it. To <hi>walk</hi> is a generall word in this place, it is of a great extent and comprehends a mans <hi>whole courſe,</hi> and <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>practice.</hi> A man who goes, or <hi>converſeth,</hi> whoſe <hi>courſe,</hi> and <hi>way,</hi> is according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> (whatſoever that fleſh is, as we ſhall ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) ſuch a man <hi>walks.</hi> Therfore it is oft ſet downe in Scripture by ſeverall expreſſions. <hi>They that are after the law, and they of the conciſion,</hi> &amp;c. Put what words you will ſo they be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall enough, they whoſe <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>words,</hi> and <hi>courſes</hi> are that way, they are they that are ſaid to <hi>walk.</hi> There are three words in the Originall for <hi>walking,</hi> and of thoſe three, the word here is of the largeſt <hi>extent.</hi> To walke according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> what is the meaning of that? I ſhall be a little lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the opening of this, I will not trouble you with the various acceptations of the word <hi>fleſh.</hi> You know there is a litterall ſence of it, and by a
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53448:133"/> 
                        <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> it is put for the whole perſon, <hi>ſoule,</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> and there is a <hi>Metonimicall</hi> acception of <hi>fleſh. I will give them a heart of fleſh.</hi> It is called <hi>fleſh</hi> for <hi>ſoftneſſe:</hi> and there is a <hi>Metaphoricall</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>fleſh,</hi> a borrowed kind of ſpeech; and ſo it is to be underſtood in this place. Now to open this to you. I ſhall ſhew you.
<list>
                           <item>Firſt, in <hi>generall</hi> what is meant by <hi>fleſh.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>Secondly, <hi>particularly</hi> what is meant by <hi>fleſh.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>fleſh</hi> therefore in generall, you are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <note place="margin">Fleſh what meant by it.</note> in this place and the like, <hi>every</hi> thing, let it be what it will be, that is <hi>againſt Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> or his <hi>worſhip,</hi> or any thing elſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to it, any thing that is <hi>not</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> or of Chriſt, it is <hi>fleſh,</hi> in generall. Let me ſpeake more plainly, <hi>any</hi> thing that is of <hi>Old Adam</hi> is <hi>fleſh,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>evill,</hi> and any thing that is of, and from the <hi>new</hi> Adam that is <hi>ſpirit.</hi> Now you <note place="margin">Two things from old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
                        </note> know we receive two things from <hi>Old Adam:</hi> ſome naturall, morall <hi>good,</hi> ſome reliques of that that he had the fulneſs of, and we receive <hi>evill,</hi> when he was <hi>corrupted.</hi> Now <hi>both</hi> theſe take them in the largeſt extent, they are both called <hi>fleſh</hi> in Scripture, whatſoever is of, and comes from <hi>Old Adam,</hi> is called fleſh, therfore <hi>fleſh</hi> in many <hi>places</hi> in the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament it is the <hi>very</hi> ſame with the <hi>Old Man,</hi> and you have them taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, <hi>Our old man is crucified.</hi> Rom. 6. And in another place. <hi>Thoſe that are Christs have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the fleſh,</hi> not only the <hi>corruption,</hi> or <hi>evill,</hi> that <hi>Originall</hi> ſin (as we ſay) that is <hi>within</hi> us, but whatſoever of the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>old man</hi> is <hi>upon</hi> us: whatſoever we have had, whether it be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi>

                     <p>Now both theſe <hi>Adams</hi> are as <hi>two ſprings</hi> in a hill, conveying their ſtreames to <hi>two</hi> rivers; they are ſprings from whence ariſe all the <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>imaginations,</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> and <hi>proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> all the <hi>wiſedome</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> whatſoever is in us, it ſprings eyther from the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> the Lord Jeſus planted in the ſoule, or elſe it flowes from <hi>Old Adam,</hi> from naturall <hi>Adam</hi> that is in us.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſay, to underſtand this a little in generall, before I goe further. A man that <hi>walks</hi> according to the <hi>fleſh</hi> who is he? A man that walks accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any thing of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> whether it be <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>evill.</hi> And uſually in the new Teſtament it is taken for the good. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.

                        <pb n="255" facs="tcp:53448:134"/> and <hi>righteouſly</hi> in the eye of the World, yet if it be after the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> if he doe not walke by a <hi>principle</hi> planted in him from the <hi>new Adam,</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, all this is but <hi>fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now then for a man to walk according to the <note place="margin">To walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit what.</note> 
                        <hi>ſpirit.</hi> What is that? All his <hi>principles</hi> ſpring from the root of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> from the ſpirit of the <hi>Lord Jeſus;</hi> all his actions are upon another ground. Now, I ſay, all the <hi>principles,</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> of every man, and woman in the World, ſprings from one of theſe. Therefore it is convenient and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that you conſider how the <hi>two Adams</hi> are the two <hi>ſprings</hi> of all <hi>mankind,</hi> the two <hi>pillars</hi> (as it were) upon which God hath <hi>layd</hi> all <hi>mankind,</hi> and all that is done in the World, and thoſe that walk after the <hi>one,</hi> walk after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and thoſe that are after the other walk after the <hi>ſpirit:</hi> So much in generall.</p>
                     <p>Now more particularly, by <hi>walking</hi> after <note place="margin">Three things meant by wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh.</note> the <hi>fleſh,</hi> in this place, there are Three things meant.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing meant by <hi>walking</hi> after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> according as moſt of our godly and learned tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <note place="margin">1. To walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature.</note> it, is when a man walks according to the <hi>dict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,</hi> and <hi>ſuggeſtions</hi> of <hi>corrupt</hi> nature. So fleſh is taken for <hi>Originall</hi> ſin, that is, that <hi>corruption</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> that is <hi>prone</hi> to every <hi>evill,</hi> and that is an <hi>enemy</hi> to all <hi>good.</hi> So a man that walks according to the fleſh, is when the <hi>courſe,</hi> and <hi>bent,</hi> of a mans <hi>ſoule,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> goes after <hi>ſin,</hi> though he doe ſome <hi>good</hi> ſometimes, yet when his <hi>courſe</hi> is that way, that is, his <hi>continuedneſs,</hi> and <hi>contentedneſſe</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53448:135"/> 
                        <hi>ſin</hi> this is to <hi>walk</hi> after the <hi>fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, when it is his <hi>continued</hi> courſe: for <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is not a <hi>ſtep,</hi> or a <hi>leape,</hi> or a <hi>ſtride:</hi> but <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is a thing of <hi>many</hi> paces. So it is called a goe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>from iniquitie to iniquitie.</hi> Rom. 6.</p>
                     <p>And then there is in walking <hi>contentedneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſweetneſs:</hi> a man is not ſayd to walke when he is <hi>tyred,</hi> or when he goes in <hi>danger,</hi> but <hi>walking</hi> it is <hi>pleaſant</hi> to all, <hi>young</hi> and <hi>old.</hi> So when he ſaith they that <hi>walk</hi> according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that is, not only when men are <hi>overtaken</hi> by luſts, and <hi>ſin,</hi> but people that in their <hi>ordinarie</hi> courſe goe with a great deale of <hi>contentment</hi> in evill wayes.</p>
                     <p>But, though this be true that this is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <note place="margin">Which is not the mayne ſcope here.</note> in walking after the fleſh, yet this is very lame, and ſhort, of the full, and whole meaning of this place. I ſay it is not the <hi>maine</hi> nor <hi>cheife</hi> meaning of this place, it is not primarily, nor principally meant: this is a truth, and it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as a neceſſary <hi>conſequence,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew anon, and I doubt not but the Apoſtle meanes it, when he ſayth, <hi>we walk not according to the fleſh,</hi> becauſe in Rom. 6. He takes a great deale of paines in that poynt: but I think this is not the cheife meaning. My Reaſons are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe I find that the very <hi>ſcope</hi> of this <note place="margin">1. The Apoſtles ſcope is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</note> learned Epiſtle is <hi>different,</hi> if not almoſt <hi>contrarie</hi> to this, his ſcope is not to quarrell with them for <hi>want</hi> of doing <hi>good</hi> works, and for <hi>walking</hi> in <hi>ſinfull</hi> works, but the ſcope of it is, to beat them off from their <hi>owne</hi> works, and to bring them to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and therfore he ſayth <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>juſtified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> works, he all along diſparageth their works as
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53448:135"/> they did them. Therfore I think he doth not goe ſo farr from his text, or from his ſcope as to make this the maine buſineſſe, their <hi>ſanctification</hi> or <hi>holineſs,</hi> the <hi>not</hi> walking in evill, or the <hi>walking</hi> in good works.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this cannot be the cheife ſcope of <note place="margin">2. Theſe things muſt follow which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Goſpell.</note> the place; becauſe if you take theſe words, <hi>They that walk after the fleſh,</hi> in this ſence, that is, thoſe that follow <hi>ſinfull</hi> courſes, if you take them ſo; that none but ſuch as walk <hi>holily</hi> have a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>righteouſneſſe.</hi> Or if you take them in this ſence that they only that <hi>walk</hi> in a <hi>holy</hi> life can come to know that they have the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of Chriſt <hi>fullfilling</hi> the <hi>law</hi> for them, neyther of theſe can hold.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, that <hi>no</hi> man can have to <hi>doe</hi> with <note place="margin">1. That none have to doe with Chriſt but thoſe that walk holily.</note> 
                        <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his <hi>righteousneſse</hi> but that man that <hi>walks</hi> according to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> that walks in a <hi>holy</hi> way, and not in <hi>ſinfull</hi> courſes, this is <hi>contrarie</hi> to the ſtreame of the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> Why? Becauſe the <hi>Goſpell</hi> all along <hi>offers</hi> Chriſt to <hi>ſinners,</hi> to the <hi>cheife</hi> of ſinners, to <hi>aliens,</hi> and to the <hi>ungodly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then againe if this were ſo, <hi>ſanctification</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Sanctification ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> ſhould be before <hi>juſtification,</hi> a man muſt be <hi>holy</hi> before he ſhould be <hi>juſtified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the latter ſence, to wit that the Apoſtle ſhould meane this, that no man can <hi>know</hi> any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way that the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of Chriſt did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him, but only, by not <hi>walking</hi> after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> or by <hi>walking</hi> after the <hi>ſpirit;</hi> this cannot be neyther: for however we may <hi>know</hi> a little in a way of ſence by our walking, yet the <hi>maine</hi> way to know our <hi>juſtification</hi> is the ſame way that we
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53448:136"/> come by <hi>juſtification: for faith is the evidence of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Juſtification cheifly known by Faith.</note> 
                        <hi>things not ſeen.</hi> The maine evidence whereby I know I am juſtified, is becauſe the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> ſayth ſo, the <hi>word</hi> tells me ſo, and <hi>faith</hi> evidenceth it. That <hi>faith</hi> that I beleive by, it ſhewes me that I beleive. Therfore though I be <hi>inconſtant</hi> in my way of grace, that to ſence ſhewes me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet it doth it not ſolely, and <hi>cheifly,</hi> and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily.</hi> So that this is the ſubſtance of it; that that <hi>ſence</hi> which godly reverend men give of this place, it is <hi>true,</hi> but it is not <hi>all,</hi> nor the firſt, and the <hi>cheife</hi> part of the meaning of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>fleſh</hi> in the Scriptures, and ſo here <note place="margin">2. Fleſh taken for Jewiſh pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</note> and in diverſe other places, it may be underſtood concerning the <hi>priviledges,</hi> thoſe various <hi>preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> and <hi>priviledges,</hi> that the people of God, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had in a <hi>naturall, fleſhly</hi> way, from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, to Generation. Being borne of ſuch <hi>Parents,</hi> of ſuch <hi>Tribes,</hi> they had ſuch <hi>priviledges</hi> belonging to them, they had the <hi>Oracles,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Tables,</hi> &amp;c. And this is called <hi>fleſh:</hi> and I doubt not, but the Apoſtle had this in his eye. Sayth he; <hi>The righteouſneſſe of the law is fulfilled in us that walk not after the fleſh.</hi> As if he had ſaid, doe not think becauſe you are of the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or becauſe you have the <hi>Covenants,</hi> and <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and that you are borne of ſuch <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> that therfore you ſhall the ſooner have this <hi>priviledg</hi> to have the <hi>law fulfilled,</hi> take heed of that, for now it ſprings from another root, and it comes now in a <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and not in a <hi>fleſhly</hi> way as it did before: for they had their <hi>mercies</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> according to the <hi>fleſh:</hi>
                        <pb n="259" facs="tcp:53448:136"/> that is, by <hi>Generation, I ſaak</hi> as he was <hi>Abrahams</hi> Son, and <hi>Jacob,</hi> his Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but now it is in a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> way.</p>
                     <p>Now that fleſh is ſo taken in Scripture, I will give you that one place in, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Though I might alſo have confidence in the fleſh</hi> ſayth Paul, <hi>If any man thinketh that he hath whereof he might truſt in the fleſh, I more.</hi> What doth he meane by <hi>fleſh</hi> here? He tells you. <hi>Circumciſed the eight day, of the ſtock of Iſraell, of the Tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the law, a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee; concerning zeale, Perſecuting the Church: Touching the righteouſneſſe which is in the law, blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I had all the <hi>priviledges,</hi> if any man might boaſt in the fleſh, I might, I am an <hi>Hebrew</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of the beſt <hi>deſcent,</hi> &amp;c. So in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18. <hi>Seeing that many glory after the fleſh, I will glory alſo, yee ſuffer fooles gladly. Wherein any is bold I am bold alſo. Are they Hebrews? ſo am I, are they Iſraelites ſo am I, are they the ſeed of Abraham? ſo am I.</hi> They had <hi>priviledges</hi> beeing <hi>Iſraelites</hi> more then other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and this is called fleſh. So I am confident that the Apoſtle had this in his eye, in a ſpeciall manner, when he ſaith, <hi>They that walke not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh.</hi> And you ſhall find that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed all priviledges to them becauſe they were Iſraelites. As you ſee in <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. Say they, <hi>We are the Children of Abraham.</hi> Sayth John <note place="margin">The Jewes boaſted of outward pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</note> Baptiſt. <hi>Ye are a Generation of Vipers.</hi> And ſo in <hi>John</hi> 8. Say they, we are <hi>free men, we are the Sons of Abraham.</hi> Sayth Chriſt. <hi>Yee are of your Father the Devill.</hi> See, the <hi>Goſpell</hi> takes away that <hi>fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs,</hi>
                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:53448:137"/> and puts all in another <hi>ſtreame</hi> and courſe, and way. The Apoſtle aymes at that here, when he ſayth. <hi>Thoſe that walke not according to the fleſh.</hi> As if he had ſayd, you ſhal never have this <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi> to ſatisfie the <hi>law</hi> the ſooner becauſe you are the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> no more then if you were <hi>Scithians,</hi> or <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, the maine, and cheife <note place="margin">3. Fleſh taken for the old Covenant of works.</note> meaning of this place is this, though the other be included, when the Apoſtle ſayth <hi>thoſe that walk not according to the fleſh, but according to the ſpirit.</hi> By fleſh, here the Apoſtle meanes <hi>walking</hi> according to the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> according to the Covenant of <hi>works,</hi> in the way of the <hi>law.</hi> And by <hi>ſpirit</hi> is meant <hi>walking</hi> in the way of <hi>faith,</hi> or in the way of the <hi>gospell,</hi> or in the way of <hi>Christ.</hi> There be diverſe expreſſions in Scripture that help us to underſtand it, as in Rom. 4. 14. It is called, <hi>they that are of the Law,</hi> that is, thoſe that <hi>walk</hi> according to the <hi>law.</hi> In Gal: 3. there are two or three phraſes, <hi>Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith.</hi> The <hi>walking</hi> according to the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is the <hi>hearing</hi> of <hi>faith:</hi> and it is twiſe there, they that are of <hi>faith,</hi> they that are of <hi>faith.</hi> To <hi>be</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> and to <hi>walk</hi> according to the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is the ſame; to be of the <hi>law,</hi> or of <hi>circumciſion,</hi> is to <hi>walk</hi> according to the <hi>fleſh.</hi> In <hi>Rom. 10. 5. The righteouſneſse which is of the law ſayth on this wiſe.</hi> The <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of the law, that is, the <hi>way</hi> of the law: that Scripture ſets out the <hi>way</hi> of thoſe that <hi>walk</hi> according to the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of <hi>works;</hi> now the <hi>way</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> is the ſame as <hi>walking</hi> after the fleſh: and ſayth hee, <hi>the</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, I ſhall give you a few Reaſons why the Apoſtle ſaith that they that <hi>walk</hi> according to the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> walk according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and they that goe according to the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> walk according to the <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the Firſt, that fleſh is often taken <note place="margin">1. prooved by Scriptures.</note> clearly in this ſence, I will give you ſome places of Scripture. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 3. This I would learn of you, <hi>received you the ſpirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Are ye ſo fooliſh, that having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the ſpirit, are you now made perfect in the fleſh.</hi> We ſee in Chap. 1. They are called to the grace of Chriſt through the Goſpell, <hi>Goſpell principles</hi> were rightly and ſavingly practiſed among them; and after there came ſome among them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted them; and ſayth he, <hi>are ye ſo fooliſh that having begun in the ſpirit,</hi> and have had <hi>Christ crucyfied among you,</hi> that <hi>now you will be made perfect by the fleſh?</hi> That now you will goe, and ſeeke juſtification, by your <hi>owne works,</hi> and goe about to <hi>keep</hi> the <hi>law,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Another place is in Phillip. 3. 4. <hi>Though I might alſo have confidence in the fleſh,</hi> and then he ſpeakes of the <hi>priviledges</hi> of an <hi>Iſraelite:</hi> and if you looke further, Verſ. 7. <hi>I count all theſe loſs that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having mine owne righteouſneſs which is of the law, but that which is of the faith of Chriſt.</hi> So by fleſh he meanes <hi>the righteouſneſſe of the law,</hi> which he throwes away, for the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> which is of <hi>faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take another place, Rom. 10. 5. Compared with Rom. 6. 14. Sayth the Apoſtle, <hi>ſin ſhall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the law,</hi>
                        <pb n="263" facs="tcp:53448:138"/> 
                        <hi>but under grace.</hi> When you were <hi>under</hi> the <hi>law,</hi> and walked after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> ſin had <hi>dominion</hi> over you, and you <hi>obeyed</hi> it. Here is a paralell place: for ſayth the Apoſtle, <hi>When you were in the fleſh, the motions of ſin by the law did Work in your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi> When you were in the fleſh, that is, when you were <hi>under</hi> the <hi>law,</hi> then the <hi>motions of ſin did work.</hi> But now <hi>ſin ſhall not have dominion over you; becauſe you are not under the law:</hi> you are not in the fleſh, you doe not walk according to the fleſh. And that I ſuppoſe is the meaning of that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 10. The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly, and to reſerve the wicked to be puniſhed; but cheifly thoſe that walk after toe fleſh, in the lusts of uncleanneſs.</hi> Now if you take walking after the <hi>fleſh</hi> for <hi>ſinfull</hi> wayes, it would be the ſame, as if he had ſaid, there are diverſe people that walk <hi>wickedly,</hi> but cheifly they that walk after the <hi>fleſh:</hi> for <hi>all</hi> people <hi>naturolly</hi> walk after the <hi>fleſh:</hi> but theſe were a <hi>peculiar</hi> people that the Lord would bring judgements on, and they walked according to the <hi>fleſh.</hi> Who were they? They were moſt of them <hi>Jewes,</hi> they were <hi>Adams</hi> Sons, that walked in the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> cheifly they that walk according to the <hi>fleſh;</hi> that is the meaning of it, or elſe he would not have ſaid <hi>according</hi> to the <hi>fleſh:</hi> for every man naturally walks according to the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>So in this text, <hi>Who walke not according to the fleſh but according to the ſpirit,</hi> and in the 8 Verſe of this Chapter. <hi>They that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> Now I ſhall open that by another Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5. Where it is ſaid that
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53448:139"/> 
                        <hi>Henoch pleaſed God.</hi> We read of <hi>Henoch. Gen.</hi> 5. 24. That he <hi>Walked with God;</hi> he walked not according to the fleſh: now ſayth the Apoſtle, <hi>without faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God;</hi> now he that walks in the <hi>fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> Why ſo? He that goes not in the way of <hi>faith</hi> by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he cannot <hi>pleaſe</hi> God. By <hi>beleiving</hi> I pleaſe God, by walking in the <hi>obedience</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> to God, <hi>I,</hi> and my <hi>works</hi> pleaſe God. Now to pleaſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies one that was <hi>offended</hi> before: all my <hi>doing</hi> cannot pleaſe God, but my <hi>beleiving,</hi> preſenting to God a <hi>perfect righteouſneſse</hi> by faith pleaſeth God, and then all my <hi>works</hi> are <hi>accepted.</hi> There are two words for it in the Originall. One ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to <hi>pleaſe</hi> one that hath been <hi>offended:</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>pleaſingneſſe</hi> with one that hath <hi>not</hi> offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as my <hi>child</hi> pleaſeth me though he have <hi>not offended</hi> me; but the other is to be <hi>pleaſed</hi> with one that was an <hi>Enemy</hi> before, one that was <hi>againſt</hi> me, that is now received to <hi>favour.</hi> So I have told you breifly ſome Scriptures to ſhew you that fleſh is taken in this ſence.</p>
                     <p>Now the maine reaſon of it why I beleive this <note place="margin">It is the ſcope of this Epiſtle</note> to be the <hi>cheife</hi> meaning of it, is becauſe that I ſee clearly that this is the <hi>cheife drift</hi> and <hi>ſcope</hi> of this Epiſtle, and if I may ſpeake without diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, there is nothing more <hi>methodically</hi> layd downe; and this is ſpoken to bring them from the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>works,</hi> to the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>faith.</hi> But I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten.</p>
                     <p>Why doth the holy Ghoſt call <hi>walking</hi> after the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> and after the <hi>law,</hi> walking after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and the other <hi>walking</hi> after the <hi>ſpirit?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:53448:139"/>
                     <p>The reaſon is, becauſe there is ſo great affinity, <note place="margin">3. Why walking after the Law is called walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the fleſh.</note> and <hi>nearneſs</hi> between walking <hi>legally,</hi> and walking <hi>ſinfully</hi> that they are promiſcuouſly in Scripture taken one for another. For let a man walk, and endeavour, and doe his <hi>beſt,</hi> according to the <hi>law,</hi> and not by the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> he ſhall be ſure to walk <note place="margin">1. They are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one for another in Scripture.</note> 
                        <hi>ſinfully,</hi> and <hi>carnally;</hi> there is no help for it. If he be <hi>under the law, ſin</hi> will have <hi>dominion</hi> over him: and if he go after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> the <hi>motions</hi> of the <hi>fleſh</hi> will bring forth <hi>fruit unto death. Sin,</hi> and the <hi>law</hi> are (as it were) of ſo near a kin, that the <hi>law</hi> makes <hi>ſin</hi> more <hi>ſinfull,</hi> and the more a man ſtrives to keep the <hi>law,</hi> the more he <hi>ſins.</hi> The Apoſtle brought it ſo neare that people were ready to ſpeake non-ſence, that the law was ſin. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the objection, <hi>Is the law ſin?</hi> O no, ſayth he, <hi>ſin is the tranſgreſsion of the law.</hi> So that a man that <hi>walks</hi> according to the <hi>law,</hi> and not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the way of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> in ſpight of his heart he ſhall walk according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that is, according to the <hi>luſts</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> he can never walk holily, let him doe what he can.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond reaſon why it is called <hi>fleſh,</hi> is in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion <note place="margin">2. In alluſion to the allegorie. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.</note> to the two Sons of <hi>Abraham:</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Gall.</hi> 4. 22.

But <hi>Iſaak</hi> was not <hi>borne</hi> after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> all <hi>Fleſhly</hi> wayes could not produce <hi>Iſaak,</hi> he was a Child of <hi>promiſe,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God <hi>breathing</hi> in the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and working mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Iſaak</hi> was produced. This is an <hi>allegorie,</hi> there is a great Myſterie that you think not of, when you read of <hi>Iſhmaell,</hi> and <hi>Iſaak.</hi> By <hi>Iſhmaell</hi> is meant the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>works,</hi> and the <hi>principles</hi> of it, and the <hi>practicioners</hi> of it, and they <hi>walk</hi> according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> as <hi>Iſhmaell</hi> did: and by <hi>Iſaak</hi> is meant the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>grace;</hi> and thoſe that goe that way, are Children of <hi>promiſe,</hi> as <hi>Iſaak</hi> was. So God hath ſet this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon and I conceive the Apoſtle alludes to it, and calls it a <hi>walking according to the Fleſh.</hi> As if he had ſayd, thou ſhalt <hi>never</hi> have this <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> by walking in the <hi>way</hi> of thy Father <hi>Iſhmaell,</hi> by <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> by walking in the <hi>law</hi> to turne away the <hi>wrath</hi> of God: but if thou wilt get this <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> thou muſt <hi>walk</hi> according to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> thou muſt get the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and be a Child of promiſe.</p>

                     <p>The third, and laſt reaſon that I ſhall give, why it is called walking according to the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>weakneſſe:</hi> for <hi>Fleſh</hi> is put for <hi>weakneſse;</hi> as the Scripture ſayth. <hi>They are Fleſh, and not ſpirit;</hi> that is, they are poore <hi>weak</hi> things: ſo, thoſe that walk in that way, in the way of the <hi>law,</hi> they are <hi>weak</hi> creatures; there is nothing, but <hi>wiſhing,</hi> and <hi>woulding,</hi> and <hi>covenanting,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing,</hi> and <hi>proteſting,</hi> and <hi>vexing,</hi> and <hi>fretting</hi> but there is no <hi>strength.</hi> Now one <hi>Saint</hi> that is truly planted in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Goſpell hath truely taken place in his heart, he hath more <hi>ſtrength</hi> then five hundred of the other. Sayth <hi>Paul; I can doe all things, I can want, and I can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,</hi> I can goe to Priſon freely, I can <hi>rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and mourne with them that mourne.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>ſpirit</hi> that dwells in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and works effectually, the ſame ſpirit dwells in <hi>us,</hi> and works in <hi>us.</hi> Therfore that is the meaning of it; they <hi>that walk after the Fleſh;</hi> that is, they that goe after the <hi>law,</hi> they are weake, they tugg, and are never the nearer Heaven; and if they ſhould live a thouſand yeares they would be no better, but <hi>wiſhers,</hi> and <hi>woulders,</hi> and ſay I have a good <hi>deſire</hi> to doe as the Preacher ſayth, but I have no power.</p>
                     <p>Let me conclude with one word of Uſe, from all this that hath been ſayd, which I hope you <note place="margin">

                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> That few ſhal be ſaved.</note> will conſider of. From this Doctrine thus open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you may hence ſee the ſaying of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt verified, and made good, that <hi>few</hi> ſhall <hi>enter</hi> into the Kingdome of <hi>Heaven.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Paul</hi> did not looke on <hi>ſinners,</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> as
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53448:141"/> we doe: we account every Profeſſor, let his principles be what they will, eyther from the <hi>firſt,</hi> or <hi>ſecond Adam;</hi> if he begin to <hi>leave ſin,</hi> and to <hi>performe duties,</hi> we account him a <hi>good</hi> man. But the Lord when he comes to judge, he will looke further, and examine us, and will (I feare) find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance that ſhal never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, even of thoſe that follow <hi>good old A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> I meane there are abundance of Profeſſors, that have left corrupt Adam in his <hi>groſneſſe,</hi> and follow good <hi>old Adam</hi> that is a ſprig from that: they will <hi>abstaine</hi> from <hi>ſins,</hi> and they will <hi>performe duties,</hi> and they will doe no <hi>wrong;</hi> and all is but <hi>old Adam</hi> ſtill. Now, good, or bad, if it be <hi>old Adam,</hi> it muſt <hi>periſh,</hi> the <hi>bond Woman</hi> muſt be <hi>caſt</hi> out.</p>
                     <p>Therfore you that are Profeſſors, looke to your ſelves for the Lords ſake, I am miſtaken if there be not many hundreds of us that will be found the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Iſhmaell</hi> at the laſt day: many that make a great Profeſſion, and many that make a <hi>greater profeſſion</hi> then others, that are honeſt, ſpirituall, Saints before the World, before men: for when a man goes to keep the <hi>law,</hi> every light that comes into his ſoule <hi>intends</hi> his <hi>reſolution;</hi> every thing intends it in that courſe he is in; and he may goe to the <hi>higheſt,</hi> and be the greateſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,</hi> and be ready for all duties, and yet be found a <hi>ſtranger</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt: therfore look to your ſelves.</p>
                     <p>I remember Mr. <hi>Belton</hi> that bleſſed man, he divides the World for the <hi>fowneſs</hi> of them that ſhall be ſaved; ſayth he the greateſt part of the

I ſay abundance of thoſe Profeſſors will come to nothing; for when the <hi>feare</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>damnation</hi> is gone from their conſcience, when the <hi>Whip</hi> is gone, they will <hi>turne the grace of God into Wantonneſſe.</hi> Nay, ſome will turne downe right <hi>Enemies,</hi> and <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> as the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> and of thoſe that would come in, in all probabilitie, in <hi>removing</hi> and <hi>tranſlating</hi> them from the <hi>law</hi> to the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> there is not one in ten but would <hi>turne the grace of God into wantonneſſe,</hi> and there goes all their

                     <p>Therfore I ſay we may hence learne to judg <note place="margin">How to judg who are Saints and who not.</note> 
                        <hi>rightly</hi> of <hi>Perſons,</hi> who are <hi>Saints,</hi> and who are <hi>not,</hi> who are the <hi>Children of God,</hi> and who are <hi>not.</hi> For in moſt things we doe not judg <hi>rightly,</hi> we doe not judg as <hi>God judgeth.</hi> We uſually judg of men, and things, according to <hi>naturall</hi> wiſdome, or according to ſome <hi>diſtinctions,</hi> and <hi>deſinitions</hi> that we have of things, in that <hi>naturall divinitie</hi> we have. As for inſtance. If a man leave his <hi>drunkenneſſe,</hi> and <hi>whordome,</hi> and come up to ſome kind of <hi>holineſſe</hi> in his <hi>lips,</hi> in appearance, if he come to heare <hi>Sermons,</hi> and <hi>repeat</hi> them, and <hi>pray</hi> a little in his Familie, that man we call a Saint, a godly man, and it may be, he may be <hi>ſo,</hi> and it may
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53448:143"/> be <hi>not</hi> ſo. Now the way that God <hi>judgeth</hi> of all men, is as they are the <hi>Children,</hi> oyther of the <hi>old,</hi> or of the <hi>new Adam,</hi> and not according to ſuch a proportion of <hi>ſtrictneſs</hi> in their lives: for the <hi>Phariſees</hi> went beyond many weak <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> in <hi>common</hi> righteouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p>And this ſhould be a mayne ground of our <note place="margin">Ground of fellowſhip with others.</note> 
                        <hi>communion,</hi> and <hi>fellowſhip,</hi> and delight in others, whether in <hi>Churches</hi> or otherwiſe.

                     <p>Firſt you ſhall find in Rom. 6. that thoſe that <note place="margin">1. Such are dead to ſin.</note> are under <hi>grace,</hi> or that walk according to the <hi>ſpirit, ſin</hi> is <hi>deſtroyed</hi> in them, they are <hi>dead</hi> to <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>alive</hi> to <hi>righteouſneſſe.</hi> And there are many expreſſions of the ſame thing in diverſe phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. As in Verſ. 6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified, that the bodie of ſin might be destroyed that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi> If thou be a man that <hi>walkeſt</hi> according to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> thou canſt ſay <hi>the body of ſin is deſtroyed,</hi> and thou doeſt not <hi>ſerve ſin,</hi> Then it is ſayd in Verſ. 11. That thoſe that are under <hi>grace,</hi> they are <hi>dead indeed to ſin, and alive to God;</hi> that is another expreſſion. And in Verſ. 12. <hi>Sin ſhall not raigne in their Mortall bodies,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>obey it in the luſts thereof.</hi> And in Verſ. 13. <hi>Yeild not your members as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> And in Verſ. 14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over them.</hi> So, there are diverſe expreſſions of one, and the ſame thing. Now from all (for I cannot open them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, how much is held forth in each of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, but to help thee to ſee a little the State of thy ſoule) I would gather theſe three things from all theſe expreſſions, there is I ſay meant by them theſe three things.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing is this, that thoſe that walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">1. Sin is dead in reſpect of guilt.</note> to grace, and according to the ſpirit, <hi>ſin</hi> is <hi>dead</hi> in them. That is, they are dead, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the guilt of ſin, they doe ſee, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in ſome meaſure, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by his death hath <hi>aboliſhed,</hi> and <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> and done away all their ſins, in reſpect of the <hi>guilt</hi> of them; they are not under the <hi>law</hi> in that reſpect. They ſee
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53448:145"/> that there is a full righteouſneſſe in Jeſus Chriſt, that hath ſatisfied the law, and ſo their ſins are done <hi>away,</hi> that they ſhall never <hi>condemne</hi> them. This is one thing.</p>
                     <p>Now a man that walks according to the fleſh, he ſees not that, neyther can ſee it: for theſe things are ſpirituall. Now take a man that <hi>walks</hi> according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that is, according to the moſt refined <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>old Adam;</hi> and he alway carries <hi>guilt</hi> upon his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way be as a man that is rouling of a <hi>Snow-ball,</hi> the more he goes on in his <hi>Service,</hi> the more <hi>guilt,</hi> and horrour. But a man that <hi>walks</hi> according to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> let him be <hi>weake</hi> or <hi>ſtrong,</hi> he ſees this in ſome meaſure (and probably for the moſt part) that his <hi>ſins</hi> are done <hi>away,</hi> and that there is no <hi>condemnation</hi> to him, becauſe he is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>beleives</hi> in him: therfore as it is. Rom. 5. 7. <hi>He that is dead is freed from ſin,</hi> or <hi>juſtified</hi> from ſin. That is one thing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in all theſe phraſes this is held forth <note place="margin">2. Sin is dead in reſpect of the power.</note> to us (as I underſtand) that a beleiver being <hi>plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> into <hi>Chriſt</hi> (for ſo he looks upon himſelfe) and <hi>ingrafted</hi> and <hi>united</hi> to Chriſt, in reſpect of the power of ſin he accounts it as <hi>dead:</hi> that is, when he ſees any ſin <hi>ſtirring</hi> in him, he conſiders, I am one with Chriſt, I am <hi>planted</hi> with him in his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>reſurrection,</hi> and this ſin was <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> when Chriſt was <hi>condemned,</hi> and as ſure as Chriſt did die, this ſin muſt die; therfore he looks upon all his <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>luſts,</hi> as things that are <hi>gaſping</hi> for life, as things that are ready to <hi>die,</hi> and that will <hi>ſurely</hi> die, as ſurely as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did <hi>die.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:53448:145"/>
                     <p>Another man that <hi>walks</hi> according to the <hi>law,</hi> when he ſees <hi>ſin</hi> in him, and finds <hi>luſts</hi> to riſe in his ſoul, he ſayth as David in another caſe. <hi>Surely I ſhall one day fall by the hands of Saul.</hi> Surely, I ſhall prove an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> one time or other, this ſin will break my <hi>neck,</hi> and ſo he is diſcouraged, and his heart is hardened. But a man that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>grace,</hi> that walks according to the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> let ſin be never ſo <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>prevalent,</hi> he looks on it as a <hi>condemned</hi> thing, he can triumph over it when it is ſtrongeſt, and can ſay, I know thou muſt be layd in the <hi>Grave</hi> with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> he reckons himſelfe dead to ſin. That is another thing.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, from all theſe expreſſions <note place="margin">3. They are more holy then others.</note> here in Rom. 6. We gather this, that ſurely all thoſe, that are under <hi>grace,</hi> or that <hi>walk according to the ſpirit,</hi> in ſome eminent way, are more <hi>holy,</hi> and more <hi>freed</hi> from ſin then once they <hi>were,</hi> and then all thoſe are that walk under the <hi>law,</hi> in ſome eminent way I ſay they are more <hi>holy,</hi> though I doe not ſay there is no ſin in them, for then we ſhould <hi>lye</hi> as <hi>John</hi> ſayth, but certainly there is a <hi>power</hi> in their ſoules againſt <hi>ſin,</hi> that is exceedingly <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent</hi> in reſpect of the beſt <hi>morall</hi> men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>exacteſt</hi> men in the World, that walk according to the <hi>law,</hi> what elſe is the meaning of all this. <hi>Yee are dead to ſin,</hi> and <hi>ſin ſhall not reigne and have dominion over you,</hi> and you ſhall <hi>not yeild your members as inſtruments to ſin?</hi> Shall we turne all this into <hi>ſpeculation?</hi> No, certainly, there is ſome <hi>eminent,</hi> reall holyneſſe and power againſt ſin that they had not before. Therfore ſaith he, <hi>VVhat pleaſure had you in thoſe things whereof ye are</hi>
                        <pb n="278" facs="tcp:53448:146"/> 
                        <hi>now aſhamed?</hi> thoſe ſins that you committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you are now aſhamed of them.</p>
                     <p>And let me looke a little upon my owne ſoule, or appeale to you, take any man, or woman, that underſtands what it is to be under the <hi>law,</hi> what it is to walke according to the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>works,</hi> and according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and what <hi>covenants,</hi> and <hi>reſolutions,</hi> and <hi>promiſes,</hi> and <hi>faſtings</hi> he had, and let him looke upon himſelfe, what he is now ſince he hath knowen a little of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and hath knowen that he is a <hi>juſtified</hi> Perſon, and that he is <hi>dead</hi> to the <hi>law,</hi> and the like. I appeale to you, whether you doe not feele a ſtrange <hi>power</hi> in your ſoules <hi>killing,</hi> and <hi>ſubduing</hi> ſin, that you never imagined before, or almoſt hoped to have. There are ſome Saints that I know, that when they came to know a little of Jeſus Chriſt, they have found a <hi>power</hi> to ſubdue their <hi>ſins,</hi> that they did not hope for in their other condition, they were ſo ſtrong; it is an emynent power. A poore Saint that ſees ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>tugging,</hi> and <hi>ſtriveing,</hi> and <hi>wraſtling,</hi> and <hi>buſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> with his <hi>corruptions,</hi> he knowes that there is a ſweet <hi>power</hi> in his ſoule that pulls downe the <hi>higheſt,</hi> and <hi>proudeſt imaginations.</hi> As a godly man ſayth, there is as much difference between a man that walks after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> according to the <hi>law,</hi> and he that walks according to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> as betweene a man that is in a great Lyter or in a great Boat, that is faſt upon the <hi>ſand,</hi> and there are it may be a dozen or twenty men tugging and ſtriving to get it off, and yet it ſticks: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man that is in a Boat upon the <hi>water,</hi> and needs onely to hoiſt ſayle, and ſit downe and it
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53448:146"/> is gone, he goes with winde, and tide. So a man that walks according to grace, he can go as a <hi>child,</hi> and ſpeake loving, and plaine words to his <hi>Father,</hi> and get power over his ſins, that all the <hi>bowling,</hi> and <hi>roaring,</hi> and <hi>crying</hi> of another a whole Yeare together cannot doe. It is ſo, and all you that know what <hi>grace</hi> is, know it. That is one thing: therefore conſider this, if thou walke according to the ſpirit, thou art <hi>dead to ſin.</hi> That is, in reſpect of the <hi>condemnation,</hi> and <hi>guilt</hi> of it, thou heareſt that Chriſt hath fulfilled the law, and that ſin is done away.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly in reſpect of the <hi>power</hi> of it; thou canſt looke upon it as a <hi>dying,</hi> gaſping thing, that muſt die, and thou canſt tread on it through the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, thou findeſt no <hi>luſt</hi> ſo <hi>ſtrong</hi> in thy ſoul, but thou canſt ordinarily <hi>bring it downe;</hi> thou canſt bring it to the obedience of Jeſus Chriſt: another man may throw his cap at his ſins, and be <hi>wiſhing,</hi> and <hi>woulding</hi> all the year long, but there are ſtrong luſts in his ſoule that will not out. Therefore ſayth the Apoſtle, when you <hi>walked</hi> according to the <hi>law, the motions of ſin brought forth fruit unto death:</hi> inevitably it will be ſo.</p>
                     <p>Then further you ſhall finde the fruits of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Fruits of walking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpirit.</note> according to the ſpirit. I will but name them to you, and wiſh you to conſider of them. You have many ſet downe in this Eighth to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</p>
                     <p>When a man walks according to the ſpirit, you ſhall ſee this is one fruit of it, a <hi>ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                        <pb n="280" facs="tcp:53448:147"/> whereby we crie abba Father. <hi>As many as</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A ſpirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</note> 
                        <hi>are led by the ſpirit of God, they are the Sons of God: for ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage againe to feare; but ye have received the ſpirit of adoption wherby we crie abba Father.</hi> That is one fruit of it, as ſoone as a man comes to <hi>walk</hi> according to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> he hath not a ſpirit of <hi>bondage</hi> any more. What is that? It is nothing but this, a temper of ſoule like a <hi>ſlave,</hi> juſt as you may conceive of a <note place="margin">Spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage what.</note> man that is taken Priſoner in <hi>Turkie</hi> what tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he is of, he is glad of a <hi>cruſt</hi> of bread, and he feares <hi>whipping</hi> and <hi>beating,</hi> and (it may be) <hi>kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:</hi> ſuch is the temper of a mans ſoule in a <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>bondage:</hi> when one is in ſuch a temper that he is alway in <hi>feare</hi> of being <hi>whipped,</hi> and <hi>ſcourged,</hi> and he hath hard <hi>thoughts</hi> of God, and he <hi>feares</hi> that he ſhall proove an <hi>hypocrite,</hi> and the like. Now ſayth the Apoſtle we have not that ſpirit, but we have the ſpirit of <hi>adoption, whereby we crie abba Father.</hi> That is, there is a ſweet temper, ſuch as is in a loving <hi>Child</hi> to his deare <hi>Father,</hi> there is a <hi>boldneſse,</hi> a <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> and <hi>rejoycing</hi> and a <hi>ſweetneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. This is one fruit of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as far as thou art under <hi>horrour,</hi> and <hi>mopeing,</hi> and <hi>howling,</hi> and <hi>crying,</hi> thou commeſt ſhort of walking according to the ſpirit: for thy ſoule would be alway full of <hi>ſweetneſſe,</hi> in the <hi>greateſt</hi> affliction, if there were a ſpirit of <hi>adoption;</hi> and under the worſt <hi>ſins</hi> thou doeſt commit, though their would be ſorrow yet thou wouldeſt be full of ſweetneſſe and joy. That is one thing.</p>

                        <hi>that we are the Children of God.</hi> If thou wilt be <hi>lead</hi> by the ſpirit, and <hi>walk</hi> after the ſpirit, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God will <hi>witneſse</hi> with thy ſpirit that thou art the Child of God. What is that? the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it is this (as I underſtand) the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> will <hi>rayſe</hi> up <hi>my ſpirit,</hi> to be able to <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>know,</hi> that I am the Child of God, for the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of a man, knowes the <hi>naturall</hi> things of a man, and no more. But the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God witneſſeth with <hi>my ſpirit,</hi> that I am the Childe of God, that is, hee rayſeth up my ſpirit whereby I may ſee, and know, that I am the Childe of God: that as before by my <hi>owne</hi> ſpirit I was able to know whether I were <hi>poore,</hi> or <hi>rich,</hi> whether I were <hi>ſick,</hi> or <hi>well,</hi> whether I were <hi>beloved,</hi> or <hi>hated:</hi> So now my ſpirit is <hi>rayſed</hi> by the ſpirit of God, I am able to <hi>reflect</hi> upon my <hi>ſelfe</hi> ſpiritually, and look upon my ſelfe as <hi>beloved,</hi> and <hi>choſen,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>called,</hi> and <hi>juſtified,</hi> and this in a ſpirituall way.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, here is another expreſſion of it, and <note place="margin">An earneſt hope.</note> that is, an earneſt <hi>hope,</hi> or <hi>expectation,</hi> of the glory that is to be <hi>revealed.</hi> I find, and obſerve little of that to be in Profeſſors, and I have oft marvailed at it, and the reaſon is, becauſe they have not the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>adoption,</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> not fully according to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> therfore they are not filled with thoſe <hi>expectations,</hi> and thoſe earneſt deſires, that the Saints were ordinarily in the primitive times. Sayth the Apoſtle in this Chapter. <hi>The creature groaneth and deſires to be delivered: and not only they, but we our ſelves, which have the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, we groane within our ſelves, waiting for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, to wit the redemption of our bodie.</hi> The
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53448:148"/> meaning is, there is no man knowes what that glory is, that is to be revealed; nor no man what it is to looke for it, and expect it. The word in the Originall is (as one ſayth) as a woman looks for <hi>deliverance</hi> when her <hi>paines</hi> are on her. O! ſhe would faine be <hi>delivered,</hi> or as a man in <hi>Priſon</hi> that looks for his <hi>freind</hi> out of a window, he puts out his <hi>head,</hi> and looks, but he cannot get out, though he faine would. Such an <hi>earnest</hi> hope, and <hi>expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi> there is in the Saints that walke according to the ſpirit, to ſee Jeſus Chriſt come, and to enjoy that glory that is to be revealed.</p>
                     <p>There are many more <hi>expreſsions</hi> there, that are the <hi>fruits</hi> of it, as the ſpirit of <hi>ſupplication,</hi> Verſ. 26.

                     <p>The reaſon is this, becauſe, as it is <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now when the Lord ſayd that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Adam</hi> to dye as a publick perſon.</note> 
                        <hi>die</hi> for ſin, conceive not, that the meaning is only, that he ſhould die <hi>perſonally,</hi> that his <hi>perſon</hi> now ſhould be <hi>ſubject</hi> to the <hi>wrath</hi> of God, to <hi>damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of ſoule, and body, for ever in Hell: that is not the only meaning of it; it is true, he fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that, but the meaning is this alſo, that whole <hi>Adam, Adam</hi> as thou art a <hi>publike</hi> perſon thou ſhalt <hi>die,</hi> that whereas I made, and appoynted thee to be the <hi>ſpring,</hi> and <hi>Foundation,</hi> of all mankind, and every man in the World is to have thy <hi>Image</hi> on him, and I have filled thee with <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>wiſdome,</hi> and good things, that may tend much to thy <hi>happineſſe,</hi> and thy poſteritie, that thou mayeſt derive a <hi>principle</hi> to them to be <hi>like</hi> thee in good, and to be <hi>pleaſing</hi> to me.

                     <p>Therefore I ſay, whatſoever now ariſeth from <note place="margin">All that ſprings from old <hi>Adam</hi> condemned.</note> the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> that ſprings from <hi>old Adam,</hi> be it good, or evill it is condemned to die, it muſt <hi>die,</hi> it cannot <hi>pleaſe</hi> God. As <hi>Adam</hi> when he had eaten the forbidden fruit, the Lord ſet an <hi>Angell</hi> with a <hi>Sword</hi> to keep the <hi>Garden,</hi> that he ſhould come in <hi>no</hi> more. Juſt ſo now ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall the Lord hath ſet a Sword as it were to keep men from all the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> that thoſe things ſhall never pleaſe God any more. Or I may ſay of it as <hi>Joſuah</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Jericho</hi> when hee had pulled down and deſtroyed it; <hi>Curſed be the man that buildeth this Citty any more.</hi> So when God pulled downe <hi>Adam</hi> for ſin, the Lord layd that <hi>curſe</hi> upon him, that he ſhould never be a <hi>bleſsing</hi> that way any more, God would never looke on him, or any thing that ſhould come from him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more: God would bethink himſelfe of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way,</hi> but that way he would not meddle with. But now this is our fault, wee are ſtill going to build <hi>Jericho</hi> againe. We are every man more <hi>apt</hi> to <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> then to <hi>ſin,</hi> ſuch a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as it is; we are apt to goe, and build up the ruines of old <hi>Adam;</hi> when we goe about the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and to doe any thing for him: or as the people of <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 1. God bids them <hi>ariſe,</hi> and <hi>goe</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and then they would not, but by and by they would goe, and then God tells them they ſhould never goe: So the time was that we might have gone the way of <hi>old Adam,</hi> when God made him righteous; if we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53448:150"/> ſo, it had been well, and the more we had endeavoured to be <hi>righteous</hi> that way, the more bleſſed we had been. But now we are <hi>fallen,</hi> and God hath <hi>curſed Adam</hi> to dye: now any one that goes that way is <hi>curſed,</hi> that goes about to repaire thoſe old ruines; no, ſaith God, doe not now anger me in ſeeking to be <hi>holy</hi> in that <hi>way</hi> as old <hi>Adam</hi> was: We muſt labour now to goe a new way and get the new <hi>Adam,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt into our <hi>ſoules.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the reaſon why (as it is cleare, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Why godly men dye as well as other.</note> 15.) men muſt dye, why godly men muſt dye as well as the wicked, <hi>It is appointed to all men to dye.</hi> Why ſo?

And ſo <hi>Rom. 7. Who ſhall deliver mee from this body of death?</hi> that is, from this <hi>body</hi> that God hath <hi>condemned</hi> to dye.

                     <p>Therfore I beſeech you, let this ſinck into you. <note place="margin">VVhy men are proud of their duties.</note> That makes you proud; that you cannot rule your hearts, but you are lifted up with pride, when you have done duties, it is becauſe every fine thing you doe from <hi>old Adam</hi> makes you proud, you take all in the <hi>bulke,</hi> and conſider not <hi>whence</hi> you doe things, you conſider not how much of the <hi>old A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> or of the <hi>new</hi> there is in your <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> Therfore, let this be an <hi>univerſall,</hi> eternall <hi>rule,</hi> to know the worth of all your ſervices and actions by, whatſoever is of the <hi>fleſh</hi> is <hi>fleſh,</hi> and whatſoever of my <hi>Preaching,</hi> and of your praying, and <hi>lending,</hi> and <hi>giving,</hi> and of your <hi>publike</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if it be not from a <hi>ſpirituall principle,</hi> from Jeſus Chriſt, according to the <hi>Goſpell</hi> planted in you, it is of <hi>old Adam,</hi> and it is condemned, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to leave that.</p>

But the New—Jeruſalem ſhall come downe from Heaven, and abundance of bleſſings that ſhall goe along with it. What is that? The meaning of <note place="margin">New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem comming downe from Heaven, what.</note> it is, we ſhall have the light of the Goſpell clearly revealed unto us, and we ſhall have Goſpell prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples fully put into our <hi>ſoules,</hi> which by <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> by <hi>Babilon</hi> we have been ſeduced of theſe thirteene or fourteene hundred yeares. For that was the miſcheife of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> he hath kept us all his reigne under the <hi>old Teſtament</hi> with <hi>Altars,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>Preiſts,</hi> and I know not what: every thing juſt as they uſed under <hi>Moſes,</hi> and we are not wholly gone out of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> yet. But the Lord will ſend a <hi>light</hi> into our hearts, to know the <hi>truth,</hi> in the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and to ſquare our <hi>hearts</hi> to it. For that is <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> if you compare it with <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. where the holy <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is clearly oppoſite to <hi>Mount Sinai:</hi> So compare it with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. he
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53448:153"/> tells us <hi>that Jeruſalem which is above us is Mother of us all;</hi> that is, <hi>the Covenant of grace,</hi> and the principles thereof in the ſoules of men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wiſh that the Lord would ſet <hi>your</hi> hearts and mine a longing after that, that we may have more of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in us; and then for matter of <hi>Government</hi> of Churches, thoſe things would follow. For to ſet up <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> before this comes into the <hi>ſoule,</hi> truely it is to build Caſtles in the <hi>ayre;</hi> for let a man take us, and frame us in the <hi>Independent,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way, in what way he will, unleſſe the Principles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Goſpel be <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> planted, it will be a <hi>fleſhly Independent,</hi> and a <hi>fleſhly Presbyterian</hi> ſervice. Therefore labour chiefly for <hi>that,</hi> and pray the Lord to <hi>fulfill that,</hi> and then your <hi>Government</hi> whatſoever it ſhall be God will <hi>reveale</hi> it more fully.

                     <p>And this alſo ſhould move us exceedingly to <note place="margin">Upon what ground to long for the comming of Chriſt.</note>

This is all <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Adam;</hi> all this ſhall be gone, and this kind of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoule</hi> ſhall be altered and changed to the Image of the bleſſed <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> we ſhall put off our <hi>earthyneſſe</hi> as well as our <hi>ſinfulneſſe,</hi> and have his bleſſed compleat <hi>Image.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now how glorious that ſhall be, as you never <note place="margin">The glory of Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> ſaw the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but onely by hear-ſay, and by reading of the Word of God, ſo you have not ſeen the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> but you may partly know by the manifeſtation of his glory on <hi>earth,</hi> you have heard much of his glory, <hi>We ſaw his glory, as of the onely begotten Son of God;</hi> we ſhall then ſee him, <hi>Phil. 3. 19. Our converſation is in Heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile bodies:</hi> He meanes vile, not onely in reſpect of <hi>ſinfulneſſe,</hi> but of <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtineſſe,</hi> of <hi>earthyneſſe,</hi> and <hi>weakneſſe; that they may be like his glorious body, according to his mighty work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelfe;</hi> that is, according to his uſuall manner of <hi>working</hi> he can doe what he will in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> We cannot conceive what an Imnge we ſhall have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53448:154"/> our <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>ſoules,</hi> but according to his <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and mighty power whereby he is able to ſubdue all things,</hi> he will doe it.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let me tell you this, I finde few, or <note place="margin">Saints for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had more lively expectations of glory by Chriſt.</note> none that have thoſe live by <hi>expectations</hi> in theſe times of that glory that is to be <hi>revealed,</hi> that the Saints of old had; See how they ſpeake of it, <hi>What manner of love is this, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God?</hi> But <hi>yet it doth not appeare what we ſhall be; for we ſhall be like him.</hi> And <hi>gird up the loynes of your minds, be ſober and watch for the glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> The <hi>Saints</hi> heretofore, more then halfe their <hi>hearts</hi> were in Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand. That is the meaning of that, <hi>Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in Heaven.</hi> Juſt as you ſee men that goe a <hi>long journey,</hi> or as you ſee people that have been <hi>plundered,</hi> that are returning to their owne <hi>homes,</hi> their <hi>converſation</hi> is there halfe a yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; their <hi>hearts</hi> and their <hi>thoughts</hi> are there, and they wiſh they were there, and think the time long, and are thinking what they will <hi>doe,</hi> and what they will <hi>be,</hi> when they come there.</p>
                     <p>So, <hi>our converſation is in Heaven,</hi> the Saints doe ſo long after the <hi>glory</hi> that is to be <hi>revealed</hi> in the day of <hi>adoption</hi> and <hi>redemption</hi> of our <hi>bodies,</hi> that the moſt part of them is there <hi>already.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now we doe not <hi>conſider</hi> of this, becauſe the <hi>new Jeruſalem</hi> is not yet come into our <hi>hearts.</hi> We have not that <hi>Goſpel-temper,</hi> and frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that the Saints had before.</p>
                     <p>That which remaines, is a little to ſhew you what your <hi>duty</hi> is that the Lord hath brought <hi>up</hi> to <hi>walk</hi> according to the <hi>ſpirit.</hi>

                     <p>The firſt is this, that the Lord having called <note place="margin">1. Not to abuſe this liberty.</note> you to this <hi>glorious, free</hi> eſtate, to this <hi>free</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that you would take heed of <hi>abuſing</hi> your <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> that you would take heed of <hi>turning the grace of God into wantonneſſe,</hi> as many doe.

                     <p>That you would take heed of <hi>uſing your liberty as an occaſion for the fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Secondly, of <hi>uſing</hi> your <hi>liberty</hi> ſo, as to give <hi>offence</hi> to your <hi>Brethren,</hi> or indeed to <hi>any.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſay firſt, beware of <hi>uſing your liberty for an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Not to uſe it as an occaſion to the fleſh.</note>

                        <pb n="299" facs="tcp:53448:156"/> things that he tells them, the one is implied (it is worth obſerving) <hi>yee are called to liberty.</hi> That <note place="margin">The Goſpell brings liberty</note> is, there is a <hi>freedome,</hi> there is a <hi>liberty</hi> in the <hi>Goſpell</hi> in diverſe things that did ſeeme to be <hi>ſinfull</hi> when ye were under the <hi>law,</hi> for elſe what ſence can you make of this, <hi>ye are called to liberty, onely uſe not your liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh.</hi> For we find that the people under the <hi>law,</hi> eyther they made the <hi>law stricter,</hi> or <hi>looſer</hi> then it was.

Before you muſt not <hi>ſmile,</hi> it was a ſin if you ſeemed to <hi>laugh,</hi> or <hi>ſmile,</hi> and a hundred ſuch things. Now <hi>you are called to Libertie, but uſe it not as an occaſion for the fleſh:</hi> That is, take not occaſion from your <hi>liberty,</hi> to live more <hi>ſinfully;</hi> to ſay <hi>you</hi> are made <hi>free,</hi> and others are <hi>tyed</hi> by the <hi>Law,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you will live more <hi>careleſly,</hi> and <hi>looſely,</hi> and <hi>ſinfully,;</hi> take heed, and beware of that. There <hi>were</hi> ſome it ſeemes: I am ſure there are ſome <hi>now,</hi> that all the <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>freedome</hi> they heare off from the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or by getting off from the <hi>Law,</hi> it is nothing in the World but that they may goe on more in <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> their <hi>luſts</hi> more <hi>freely;</hi> this is to pervert the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And what the end of theſe people ſhall be, you <note place="margin">The danger of abuſing goſpel-liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> may ſee in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. and in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude.</hi> They are appointed <hi>to damnation.</hi> And <hi>their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>

                     <p>Another thing is, ſeeing you have liberty by <note place="margin">2.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved that is farr from walking <hi>worthy</hi> according to the Goſpel; <hi>I became all things</hi> (ſaith Paul) <hi>to all men, that I might win ſome:</hi> I am <hi>under the Law to them that are under the Law, and without Law to them that are without Law.</hi> I became all things to all men that I might gaine ſome: So we muſt <hi>not pleaſe our ſelves, but one another for edification, Rom.</hi> 15. and <hi>condeſcend to them of low ſort, Rom. 12. Who is weake</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and I am not weake?</hi> If thou ſee a man under the <hi>Law,</hi> fumbling and wallowing upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> deſpiſe him not, and ſay, he is a <hi>Legalliſt,</hi> and what have we to <hi>doe</hi> with him? but endeavour to frame thy <hi>heart,</hi> and thy language, and carriage ſo <hi>ſuitable</hi> to him, that thou mayſt <hi>win</hi> upon him, and ſo with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This is the language of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and the true way of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God; when a man
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53448:157"/> knowes his <hi>freedome,</hi> and yet he <hi>becomes all things to all men,</hi> that he may doe them good. There is <hi>one</hi> word, that I thinke is the word and will of <hi>God,</hi> and I deſire that thou mayſt <hi>take</hi> it ſo, and carry it with thee.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond thing that I adviſe you to that are <note place="margin">2. To walke humbly.</note> 
                        <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> that the Lord hath <hi>revealed</hi> a little of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to it, is this, that you would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to walk <hi>humbly.</hi> O, walk humbly. Why ſo? I will tell you why, becauſe a man when he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Becauſe of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in the Goſpell.</note> the <hi>law,</hi> he ſhall be twenty yeares ſtriving for a <hi>little knowledge,</hi> or <hi>grace,</hi> and ſhall hardly get them: but as ſoone as ever a man comes rightly to Chriſt, and to <hi>know</hi> him, then there is ſuch a <hi>flood</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and ſuch <hi>abundance</hi> of <hi>Revelations,</hi> (it is the Scriptures word) there is ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>manifeſtations</hi> of GOD, and of the Image of GOD, when they begin to come in, that it is a hard thing then to keepe the ſoule <hi>downe,</hi> for <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things when they come in <hi>rightly,</hi> when the <hi>Floud-gates</hi> are <hi>open,</hi> they come in as <hi>Waves,</hi> one upon the back of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For <hi>ſpiritull</hi> Goſpell <hi>truths, multiplie</hi> in the <hi>ſoule</hi> a thouſand fold, one <hi>leſson</hi> from <hi>another,</hi> and one <hi>Scripture</hi> opens <hi>another,</hi> and then there is no end, and then it is hard to keepe the ſoule hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Therfore in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. When <hi>Paul</hi> was wrapt into the third Heavens, becauſe of the <hi>abundance of Revelations</hi> that he had ſeene (for he had ſeen and heard things that he could not utter, and ſpeake to others) he was <hi>readie</hi> to be <hi>proud,</hi> to be lifted up, and leaſt he ſhould be ſo, God <hi>ſent a Meſſenger of Satan to buffet him.</hi> It implies, it was a hard thing for <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle when <hi>abundance</hi>
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:53448:158"/> of <hi>Revelations,</hi> came into his ſoule, not to be <hi>lifted</hi> up. And this <hi>ſpoyles</hi> ſome <hi>honeſt</hi> hearts. I hope they are ſo, and that God will bring them <hi>home,</hi> that having been kept <hi>bare</hi> of <hi>food,</hi> as ſome <hi>Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> that went to releive <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> when they came home to the <hi>Cittie,</hi> they killed themſelves with eating <hi>full,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> food: So when poore ſoules have gone upon the bare <hi>Mountaines</hi> of <hi>Sinai,</hi> and then have come to the <hi>Paſtures</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> they goe ſo <hi>greedily,</hi> and are ſo taken, that if God be not wonderfull <hi>mercifull,</hi> they will be <hi>undone</hi> by being <hi>lifted</hi> up. Therfore beware of this, learne from <hi>Pauls</hi> example to ſeeke to the Lord to keep your <hi>hearts humble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A third thing is this, endeavour to walk <hi>ſimplie</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3. To walk ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</note> I meane to keepe to the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> The Goſpell, though there be <hi>glorious myſteries</hi> in it to feed the ſoule, yet notwithſtanding it is a plaine, ſimple thing. Now here the Devill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to undoe ſoules, as it is ordinary in this City, when men come once to underſtand a little of the Goſpell, and to taſt the ſweetneſſe of it, <note place="margin">The Devill makes men ſublimate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into notions.</note> the Devill ſcrews them up to ſublimate all <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> into <hi>notions,</hi> to cleave a <hi>haire,</hi> and Religion will be all in <hi>Ideas</hi> and conceits of the nature of God, and of the <hi>creature.</hi> Whereas the Goſpell is a <hi>plaine</hi> thing. <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to know the <hi>death of Chriſt, and the power of his Reſurrection.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth <hi>Servants</hi> how to obey their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> and <hi>Maſters</hi> how to carry themſelves to their <hi>Servants,</hi> and <hi>VVives</hi> to their <hi>Husbands,</hi> and ſuch ſimple plaine things. Now theſe things are accounted <hi>nothing:</hi> that is the Reaſon that many
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53448:158"/> among us, they doe more and more looſe the Word of God unleſſe it be about ſome <hi>ſublime no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> If a Miniſter be upon ſuch poynts, ſome <hi>high Ideas</hi> (for they feed upon ſuch) that is worth the while; but if a Miniſter ſpeake of things that concerne their <hi>calling,</hi> or their <hi>ſex,</hi> and <hi>condition;</hi> that is <hi>plaine,</hi> it hath <hi>no tast</hi> in it, no more then the white of an <hi>Egg.</hi> It is a hard thing to keepe to the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the <hi>Gſopell</hi> As the Devill tempted our firſt <hi>Parents,</hi> God gave <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ſufficient <hi>knowledge</hi> to doe his <note place="margin">How the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill tempted <hi>Eve.</hi>
                        </note> will: and they had ſufficient <hi>naturall</hi> knowledge, for they <hi>Named</hi> all the <hi>Creatures,</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhee muſts neds goe from the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of Gods will, and be <hi>curious,</hi> and ſhee muſt know <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>evill,</hi> there was the <hi>distinction,</hi> good, and evill, thought ſhee what kind of <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>evill,</hi> ſhee goes to this <hi>ſublime</hi> conceit, and ſo was loſt.</p>
                     <p>Now ſayth <hi>Paul</hi> I am <hi>afraid of you leaſt the Devill ſhould beguile you ſo</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am loath to <hi>offend</hi> you: for I had rather win <note place="margin">4. To het the comfort of our priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> you, or elſe I could inſtance in twenty or forty <hi>conceits</hi> and <hi>distinctions,</hi> of things, <hi>Ideas,</hi> that are above the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make us leave them, becauſe they are <hi>above</hi> the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and the <hi>excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of the Goſpell is not in thoſe Ideas, but in knowing the power of plaine things, as the death of Jeſus Chriſt. Every man in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> knew the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt: but to know the power of that <hi>death;</hi> keepe cloſe to the ſimplicity of the Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>Another thing is this, you that have knowne
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:53448:159"/> a little of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God, and have <hi>inlarged hearts,</hi> and <hi>enlightned eyes.</hi> Let not God <hi>reſt</hi> till thou find the <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of what thou <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</hi> O, we know that the righteouſneſſe of the law by Chriſt is fulfilled in <hi>us,</hi> and the like: but we have not the <hi>full comfort</hi> of ſuch a <hi>truth,</hi> and many others. We know Chriſt hath paid our debt, and that we are <hi>one</hi> with him, as he is one with the Father; but we have not the <hi>power,</hi> and the <hi>comfort</hi> of theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Beloved, for thy comfort, know that <hi>Paul</hi> in a <note place="margin">Pauls condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> ſort was in thy condition. Phil. 3. <hi>Not as though I had attained or apprehended,</hi> but I would apprehend him of whome I am <hi>apprehended,</hi> and I would know the vertue of <hi>his death,</hi> and the power of his <hi>Reſurrection. Paul</hi> ſaw ſomething that he did not <hi>fully apprehend,</hi> but he would feele more of the power of <hi>Goſpell,</hi> ſpirituall <hi>truthes,</hi> and if he ſaw that he wanted it, much more <hi>we.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O, doe not content your ſelves to have an <hi>old,</hi> frozen knowledge of Goſpell truths, whereby you are able to proove that men are <hi>legalliſts,</hi> and that men are under <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and yet have <hi>cold,</hi> and <hi>frozen</hi> hearts, <hi>cold</hi> truths without life: therefore thinke of minding God of this.</p>
                     <p>Then laſtly, labour to take heed that you be <note place="margin">5. Not to fall back from the light of the Goſpell.</note> not by any meanes <hi>bewitched</hi> ſo as to <hi>fall back</hi> from that little <hi>light</hi> in the <hi>Goſpell</hi> that you have <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> it is an eaſie thing ſo to doe.

                        <pb n="305" facs="tcp:53448:159"/> the Lord may doe for you: but I ſay it is wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>eaſie,</hi> you may under <hi>one quarter</hi> of a <hi>yeares fleſhly Preaching, loſe</hi> that that you have been under <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three yeares</hi> Preaching a <hi>getting.</hi> I have knowne, after a <hi>quarter</hi> of a <hi>yeares buylding</hi> up of my ſoule in the knowledg of Chriſt, and the <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> of my <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>aſſurance,</hi> I have heard <hi>one Sermon</hi> that hath <hi>routed</hi> and <hi>daſht</hi> all that work in my ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I beſeech you beware, <hi>faith</hi> is a <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> thing; eſpecially the light we have, that is but very <hi>weake,</hi> and very <hi>tender,</hi> therefore ſayth <hi>Paul, Who hath bewitched you, you fooliſh Gallatians, before whome Jeſus Chriſt hath been lively painted?</hi> As the word ſignifies, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was drawne <hi>lively</hi> before the <hi>Gallatians</hi> and yet they did fall. If <hi>Paul</hi> that was an Apoſtle, and had the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God in ſuch a meaſure, laying open the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Chriſt, and yet his people did goe back to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to <hi>Sinai,</hi> the Lord help, and uphold us. Therfore <hi>ſtand faſt in your liberty in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is all in ſhort I have to ſay to you for that. I hope you will lay up theſe words.</p>
                     <p>Now I have a few words of <hi>advice,</hi> and <hi>counſell</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. How thoſe that walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, may come to walk ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</note> to thoſe poor ſouls that do yet in a great meaſure <hi>walk</hi> according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> in one faſhion or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Their <hi>religion</hi> is a <hi>fleſhly</hi> Religion, from <hi>old Adam,</hi> and according to the <hi>law,</hi> in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Now the Queſtion is what ſhall they doe that they may be <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Chriſtians, that they may <hi>walke</hi> according to the <hi>ſpirit?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will only name a few things. <note place="margin">1. Study the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Teſtaments.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt is this, I would deſire you to endeavor
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53448:160"/> to ſtudie much the difference between the <hi>two</hi> Teſtaments, the <hi>new</hi> and the <hi>old.</hi> I meane not the <hi>two Bookes,</hi> but the <hi>two Testaments,</hi> that we read of in Heb. 8. &amp; Heb. 9. Whereof the one is <hi>faulty,</hi> and the other is <hi>excellent,</hi> the one is done away the other remaines. Studie the difference between them: for thereby you lay the <hi>foundation</hi> of your Goſpell-<hi>happineſſe:</hi> for there is the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of many Profeſſors, and will be their miſery if they ſhould live a thouſand yeares, they <hi>jumble</hi> both <hi>Teſtaments,</hi> without <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>diſtinction,</hi> and ſo they will never be better.</p>
                     <p>Another thing that I would exhort you to, is <note place="margin">2. To prize the ſpirit.</note> this, to prize the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Chriſt more then you doe. There is nothing in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> but it is a <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi> you cannot <hi>know</hi> it but by the ſpirit: and there is no <hi>duty</hi> in the Goſpell to be done that can be done but by the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit.</hi> We may doe many things in the <hi>law</hi> by the ſtrength of <hi>old Adam:</hi> in the <hi>Goſpell</hi> we can doe <hi>nothing,</hi> but the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is all.</p>
                     <p>And that is the reaſon I think (for I ſpeake ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grace given me) why people now are left ſo <hi>bare,</hi> and poore, and <hi>confuſed,</hi> and know not which way to goe, or <hi>what</hi> to doe, they doe not prize the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>Many men <hi>extoll Learning</hi> mightily, and it is <note place="margin">Learning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled to the diſparagement of the ſpirit.</note> accounted almoſt Hereſie to <hi>commend</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God. There are many <hi>men,</hi> I, and many <hi>Profeſsors,</hi> that doe not love to heare a man in a few <hi>modest</hi> words to <hi>commend</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God: but all muſt be by ſtudie, and reading, and learning, and for the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God it is a plaine meere <hi>Cypher,</hi> and there
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53448:160"/> is an end. But my life on it (if I had a hundred I would ſay ſo) they ſhal be <hi>beholding</hi> to the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God, and <hi>extoll</hi> him before they be <hi>taught ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;</hi> they ſhall be willing to lay downe all their <hi>learning</hi> (as I have ſeene a learned godly man of late) even with the Plow-boy.</p>
                     <p>I do not ſay, but that <hi>learning</hi> is good for ſome <note place="margin">Learning of what uſe it is.</note> uſes, and God may <hi>bleſſe</hi> it to help a man to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe what he knowes, the better: but as I told you, <hi>Adam</hi> muſt die, he cannot by it come to know one jot, of the ſpirituall meaning of God in the Goſpell, or one jot of <hi>power</hi> or <hi>aſſurance,</hi> to be <hi>happie,</hi> or to doe any thing for God: towards this, all <hi>learning</hi> is not worth a <hi>ſtraw:</hi> therefore labour to <hi>extoll</hi> the <hi>ſpirit.</hi> And if any of you have a mind to learning, goe on, I diſcourage you not from it; <hi>learning</hi> is a thing in another <hi>Element;</hi> take <hi>paines</hi> and <hi>dilligence</hi> to be <hi>learned;</hi> it is <hi>good</hi> to doe ſo. But if thou wilt be a <hi>Goſpell Christian,</hi> thou muſt <hi>thank</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God for all. Sayth <hi>Paul</hi> for all his learning, <hi>I am not ſufficient to ſpeake a good word,</hi> and he was a <hi>learned</hi> man, that <hi>Festus</hi> ſayd, <hi>Much learning had made him mad. Beza</hi> in his Comment upon 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayth, <hi>Are they Hebrews? ſo am I. Are they Jewes? ſo am I.</hi> Sayth he, I never read in any <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> Author, ſo much eloquence, and elegancie of ſpeech, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath there: and yet he Profeſſeth, he could not <hi>think a good thought</hi> (for all he was learned ſo much) much leſſe doe a good <hi>worke.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The will of God not knowne till we extoll the ſpirit.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>As long as thou keepeſt the <hi>ſpirit</hi> an <hi>underling;</hi> as a <hi>Cypher,</hi> as many of the <hi>clergie,</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> men,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53448:161"/> they extoll <hi>learning</hi> to the Heavens, and many of them upon purpoſe to <hi>deſpight</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God; as long as they doe ſo, they ſhall never know the will of God, <hi>We are not debtors to the fleſh,</hi> but we muſt be <hi>debtors</hi> to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> if we will have one true <hi>thought</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> O prayſe the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and prize the <hi>ſpirit.</hi> If you have any <hi>thought</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thank the <hi>ſpirit;</hi> if you have any <hi>glimps</hi> of him in your <hi>ſoules</hi> worth any thing, <hi>prayſe</hi> the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That is the reaſon that the <hi>Saints</hi> in the Booke <note place="margin">How Saints of Old ſpake of the ſpirit.</note> of God, <hi>ſpeake</hi> not of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God, without ſome ſpeciall <hi>epithite</hi> of <hi>commendation. Guid me by thy HOLY ſpirit,</hi> and ſayth another, thy <hi>BLESSED ſpirit,</hi> and thy <hi>GRACIOVS ſpirit,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit of GRACE</hi> ſayth another. They never <hi>ſpeake</hi> of it without ſome word that ſhewed their <hi>love to it,</hi> and their high eſteeme of it. When the Lord ſhall come, and his <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſhall be <hi>advanced</hi> in the hearts of men, we ſhall have <hi>glorious</hi> times, and never before that, and thoſe times will come. I remember <hi>Calvin</hi> on thoſe Propheſies in <hi>I ſay,</hi> and <hi>Joell. The SVN ſhall be darkned, and the MOONE ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into blood in that day;</hi> Sayth he, the meaning is, all the <hi>excellencie</hi> that a man <hi>naturally</hi> hath, his <hi>learning,</hi> and <hi>endowments;</hi> in the dayes of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi> when the <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſhall come with his <hi>light;</hi> when God ſhall <hi>exalt</hi> the <hi>ſpirit, The Sun ſhall be turned into darkeneſſe, and the Moone into blood:</hi> Men ſhal not ſo much eſteem <hi>learning</hi> from <hi>Books,</hi> but <hi>learned,</hi> and <hi>great</hi> men, and <hi>Schollers</hi> ſhall come to one <hi>claſsis,</hi> and one <hi>rank,</hi> and <hi>forme</hi> with
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:53448:161"/> 
                        <hi>ſimple</hi> people, all waiting on God by his <hi>VVord</hi> through the <hi>ſpirit.</hi> A man can take his Boy from <hi>Schoole</hi> that hath his <hi>Lattine</hi> and <hi>Greeke,</hi> and ſend him to the <hi>Univerſitie,</hi> and he aſſures himſelfe that he ſhall be as <hi>good</hi> a <hi>Miniſter</hi> as his other Sonne, that, it may be, hath ſerved the <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſeaven yeares, this is our way, and a hundred more, whereby we <hi>baſely ſlight</hi> and <hi>diſdaine the ſpirit</hi> of God, and doe <hi>not honour</hi> him, and therefore he will not honour us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if ever you will be true <hi>Goſpell</hi> Saints, <note place="margin">3. To be led by the ſpirit.</note> you muſt ſuffer your ſelves to be <hi>lead</hi> by the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God. That phraſe you find oft in, <hi>Rom. 8. Gal. 5. If you live in the ſpirit, walk in the ſpirit,</hi> be <hi>lead</hi> by the ſpirit. We are not <hi>complementary</hi> to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend</hi> the ſpirit of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But give it ſcope to <hi>lead</hi> us. You muſt heed more what the ſpirit of God ſaith unto you, and what he works on you. If there come a <hi>place</hi> of Scripture in your <hi>mind, heare,</hi> and <hi>conſider,</hi> whether the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God hath not put it in thy mind, and would have thee <hi>ſtudie</hi> it, and would have thee compare Scriptures. And when thou commeſt to doe any action whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, not ſo much to advice, with this <hi>man,</hi> or <hi>that man,</hi> but what ſayth the <hi>ſpirit</hi> (I meane according to the light of the Scripturs) harken to that more then what all the World faith. Therefore I have knowne ſome men that in their whole lives have often <hi>miſt</hi> the will of God, in <hi>circumſtantiall</hi> things uſually, it may be for a yeare or two, or three and they have miſt it againe in <hi>another</hi> thing, and in another thing. And when they have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined how this comes about, they can ſay if they
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53448:162"/> had <hi>hearkned</hi> to the ſpirit of God, they had not done ſo, but they hearkned to men, and ſo went againſt the dictates of the ſpirit, in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they would heare what this man ſaid, and what the other man did. But now the <hi>ſpirit</hi> will ſay to them, you ſee I would have ſhewed you the <hi>right</hi> way, but you would not give me <hi>ſcope,</hi> but made a <hi>Cypher</hi> of me. And for my one particular I doe not yet ſee how I ſhould ever have <hi>mist</hi> the will of God ſince I knew him if I had <hi>hearkned</hi> to the ſpirit of God, if I had but obſerved ſo much <hi>light</hi> as the <hi>ſpirit</hi> had put into my heart. Now we Ballance the ſpirit with this <hi>mans</hi> example, and with the <hi>other mans</hi> opinion, and ſo, come home by <hi>Weeping Croſs.</hi> Therefore give ſcope to the ſpirit, I meane not <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>word,</hi> or <hi>above</hi> the <hi>word,</hi> but ſtill I meane the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God working <hi>according</hi> to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and no otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Another thing, and a ſpeciall one is, I wiſh you for the myſteries of the Goſpell to ſtudy the <note place="margin">4. To ſtudie Scriptures without mens gloſſes.</note> 
                        <hi>Scriptures</hi> in the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of them without the <hi>gloſſes</hi> of Men: For a man in <hi>extremity</hi> muſt doe that that a man that is <hi>not</hi> in <hi>extremity</hi> would <hi>not</hi> doe. We have brought our ſelves in ſuch <hi>ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to Men, that we muſt take that courſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>ſober</hi> man ſhould not. I meane thus, when ever we goe to look for any <hi>truth</hi> of God, for the <hi>will</hi> of God, we have <hi>notions</hi> in our minds <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> hand, according to the times and places we live in. As concerning <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> what need I goe to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſaith one, we have it in <hi>ſuch,</hi> and <hi>ſuch Mens Writings?</hi> And ſo we <hi>foreſtall</hi> the <hi>will</hi> of God, that we are <hi>blinded,</hi> and cannot <hi>ſee</hi> it.</p>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:53448:162"/>
                     <p>Therefore if you will ſee the wil of God, I wiſh you (for a while at leaſt) to look on the <hi>naked</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Three uſes of other Books beſides the Scriptures.</note> 
                        <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And for my part I know but three u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be made of other Books.</p>
                     <p>As firſt there is this uſe of Books, you have <note place="margin">1. To ſet forth Scripture in diverſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</note> Books that will read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in diverſe <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,</hi> and ſhew the <hi>Originall,</hi> and open the <hi>tongues;</hi> now when I ſee a <hi>word</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and doubt of the meaning of it: then I will goe to the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as God hath endowed me with knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Then there is another <hi>uſe</hi> of Books, when I <note place="margin">2. To open one Scripture by another.</note> read one <hi>ſingle</hi> Scripture, it may be I have a book that will point out <hi>halfe a dozen</hi> Scriptures, to open <hi>one</hi> Scripture by.</p>

But to take books, and ſay, <hi>Jerome thinks this,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin that,</hi> and fill our heads with <hi>notions,</hi> they <hi>blind</hi> us that we cannot <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>will</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in reading of <hi>Scriptures</hi> there ſhould <note place="margin">Difference in the learning of Chriſtians, and others.</note> be this <hi>difference,</hi> from our reading of <hi>other Books,</hi> I meane in reſpect of <hi>age.</hi> When we are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and <hi>young,</hi> we uſe not <hi>Spectacles;</hi> it may be at twenty, or thirty, or fourty yeares old, we can <hi>read without Spectacles;</hi> but when we come to fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ſixty, then we can ſee nothing but through <hi>Spectacles.</hi> It ſhould be juſt contrary with us, when we are <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> When we are <hi>young</hi> we uſually never read the <hi>Word</hi> of God but through the <hi>Spectacles</hi> of mens <hi>gloſſes;</hi> but when we are older <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and ſtronger <hi>Saints,</hi> we ſhould

                        <hi>wonder not,</hi> that thou muſt be <hi>borne</hi> from <hi>above,</hi> that is, thou muſt have the <hi>Lord</hi> from <hi>above,</hi> to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi> thee againe.

That the righteouſneſſe of the Law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> In the latter end of the Verſe I ſhewed the <hi>perſons</hi> more largely deſcribed, to whom this <hi>priviledge</hi> doth belong; that is, <hi>Not thoſe that walke after the fleſh,</hi> but thoſe <hi>that walke after the ſpirit.</hi> And I have as God enabled me, opened the meaning of that to you, what it was to <hi>walk</hi>

                     <p>Onely remember what I ſaid before, for it is of great concernment; for that great <hi>priviledge</hi> depends upon this: If you have the righteouſnes of the <hi>Law fulfilled</hi> in you, you muſt be thoſe that <hi>walke</hi> according to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh: And then would you know that? Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Thoſe that are after the Fleſh doe minde the things of the Fleſh, and thoſe that are after the ſpirit, the things of the ſpirit;</hi> ſo let that be the Doctrine, or Leſſon.</p>
                     <p>I will give you but two ſhort words to prove this to you; and then to open it as God ſhall helpe us.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing to prove it is this, that it muſt <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Every thing works accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its principle.</note> be ſo, becauſe that <hi>every thing</hi> in the World, in all the creation of God doth <hi>act</hi> according to the nature of its <hi>principle</hi> from whence it flowes. As Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jam. 3. 11, 12. Doth a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſend forth from the ſame place, ſweet water and bitter? Can a Fig-tree</hi> (my Brethren) <hi>beare Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, or can a Vine beare Figs?</hi> You know that a <hi>Fig-tree</hi> beares <hi>Figs,</hi> and a <hi>Vine-tree</hi> beares <hi>Grapes,</hi> an <hi>Apple-tree</hi> beares <hi>Apples,</hi> and a <hi>Peare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, Peares,</hi> and every Tree, and <hi>every thing</hi> will
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53448:167"/> work according to its <hi>principle. Make the tree good</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>and then the fruit will be good,</hi> ſuch as the tree is, ſuch will be the fruit; ſuch as the <hi>Fountaine</hi> is, ſuch will the <hi>ſtreame</hi> be. And when a mans <hi>principles,</hi> the frame of his <hi>heart</hi> is nothing but <hi>fleſh,</hi> then of neceſſitie his <hi>actions</hi> muſt be <hi>fleſhly,</hi> his <hi>affections</hi> muſt be <hi>fleſhly.</hi> If he have a <hi>fleſhly mind,</hi> he muſt have a <hi>fleſhly will,</hi> a fleſhly <hi>love,</hi> fleſhly <hi>hatred,</hi> a fleſhly <hi>life,</hi> fleſhly <hi>prayers,</hi> fleſhly <hi>Sacraments,</hi> fleſhly <hi>every</hi> thing: for every thing muſt be according to its principle. So, on the other ſide, where the <hi>principle</hi> is <hi>ſpirituall</hi> there a man will <hi>mind ſpirituall</hi> things, he will <hi>love</hi> ſpirituall things, he will <hi>doe</hi> ſpirituall things, he will <hi>delight</hi> in ſpirituall things. That is one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it,</p>
                     <p>And the ſecond is this (for I will give you but <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Carnall men know not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things.</note> theſe two, becauſe the cheife thing that I intend at this time is the opening of it) <hi>fleſhly,</hi> carnall men that are <hi>after</hi> the <hi>fleſh,</hi> they muſt <hi>mind</hi> fleſhly things: becauſe they <hi>know</hi> not <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things, they <hi>underſtand</hi> not <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things. Or if you will, (and it may be that word hath ſomething more in it) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. They perceive not <hi>ſpirituall things,</hi> they doe not <hi>ken</hi> and <hi>Perceive</hi> them. Now you know that a man <hi>minds</hi> not (I meane look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as the acting of the underſtanding) a man <hi>cannot mind,</hi> but what he <hi>knowes:</hi> a man cannot <hi>think</hi> of things he <hi>knowes not.</hi> That is the reaſon to proove that poore <hi>ignorant</hi> people ſpeak an untruth, and deceive themſelves, when they ſay, we <hi>remember</hi> God, we <hi>mind</hi> God, whereſoever we are; and yet they <hi>know</hi> not God. For God is
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:53448:167"/> not <hi>minded,</hi> but when he is <hi>knowne.</hi> As in that place of the <hi>Corinthians; A naturall man cannot perceive the things of the ſpirit;</hi> he doth <hi>not know</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, therefore he cannot <hi>mind</hi> him; he doth not <hi>Know</hi> the things of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God, therefore he cannot ſet his <hi>heart</hi> upon them. <hi>Without Knowledg the mind cannot be good.</hi> That is, till a man have a <hi>ſtock</hi> of <hi>knowledg</hi> of things, he can never <hi>act</hi> his <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>mind,</hi> about it. There are two ſhort reaſons why thoſe that are <hi>carnall,</hi> and <hi>fleſhly,</hi> thoſe that are after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> they <hi>mind</hi> the things of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and they <hi>mind</hi> nothing <hi>elſe,</hi> nor cannot; and thoſe that are after the <hi>ſpirit, mind</hi> the things of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> becauſe they <hi>know</hi> them, they <hi>underſtand</hi> them, and <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> them, they cannot chooſe as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. But <hi>excerciſe themſelves in them, day, and night.</hi> They excerciſe their <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> and all in them.</p>

But yet to make it clearer, you muſt underſtand, that a man is ſaid to be after
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:53448:168"/> the fleſh, or carnall, for ſo they read it in Latine, <hi>Qui carnalis, &amp;c.</hi> Men are ſaid to be carnall, or after the fleſh three wayes.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is when a man is a true Saint, but hath <note place="margin">1.

Sayth <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking how <hi>ſpirituall</hi> the <hi>law</hi> is, but ſayth he, <hi>I am carnall, ſold under ſin:</hi> ſold to ſin. Not that there was <hi>no grace</hi> in <hi>Paul,</hi> but that there was ſuch <hi>abundance</hi> of <hi>corruption,</hi> at leaſt, in his feeling. So in 1 <hi>Cor. 3.

                        <hi>Babes?</hi> When I heare there are ſuch <hi>diviſions,</hi> that ſome are for <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome for <hi>Apollo,</hi> and ſome for <hi>Cephas. Are yee not carnall?</hi> are ye not after the <hi>fleſh?</hi> That is, is there not a <hi>World</hi> of <hi>corruption</hi> in you? doth not <hi>corruption rule,</hi> and beare <hi>ſway,</hi> over that <hi>little grace</hi> that is in you? So in <hi>Gal. 6. 1. If any man be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with ſin, ye that are ſpirituall reſtore ſuch done.</hi> That is, as if he had ſayd, there are ſome <hi>carnall</hi> and they cannot keepe themſelves from beeing <hi>overtaken</hi> freequently with ſin, and much leſſe can ſuch <hi>reſtore others:</hi> but a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> man, one that the <hi>ſpirit</hi> hath prevailed in ſome meaſure over the <hi>fleſh</hi> in, keeping him from the <hi>foyles,</hi> and <hi>falls,</hi> that <hi>weake</hi> men fall into, and making him able in ſome meaſure to <hi>rayſe,</hi> and heale others. Now ſo we are not to Underſtand it here in this place, when he ſayth, <hi>They that are after the fleſh.</hi>

                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:53448:168"/>
                     <p>Secondly, a man may be ſaid to be <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or to be <hi>carnall.</hi> A man that is a <hi>true Saint</hi> may be <note place="margin">2. VVhen a Saint doth a carnall action</note> called <hi>carnall,</hi> when he doth ſome <hi>one</hi> action that may in a ſence be <hi>wholly carnall.</hi> For a Saint may doe an action that he, nor none about him may perceive any thing but <hi>carnallitie</hi> in. As in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 23. Compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 32. There you ſhall ſee a <hi>godly</hi> Saint, <hi>Peter</hi> by name, when his Maſter was Preaching to him, what he ſhould <hi>ſuffer</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and how he ſhould be put to death, and the like: <hi>Then Peter tooke him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rebuke him ſaying, be it farr from thee Lord; this ſhall not be unto thee.</hi> This was a <hi>Fleſhly</hi> Speech a meere <hi>carnall</hi> Speech. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was going to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem to <hi>die</hi> for <hi>Peter,</hi> and for other poore <hi>ſinners,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> takes him aſide, and <hi>rebukes</hi> his Maſter, and tells him it ſhould not be ſo. <hi>Farr be it from thee.</hi> Chriſt takes him, and tells him. <hi>Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence to mee: for thou ſavoureſt not the things of God, but the things of men.</hi> Thou ſpeakeſt as a <hi>carnall</hi> fleſhly <hi>man,</hi> thou haſt no <hi>taſt</hi> of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things. If thou diddeſt looke on it <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> thou wouldeſt <hi>rejoyce,</hi> and pray the Lord to help <hi>thee</hi> to <hi>ſuffer</hi> in that tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with thy Maſter, or to make a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> uſe of it: but thou art <hi>carnall,</hi> and ſavoureſt of <hi>Fleſh,</hi> Now when the Apoſtle ſayth here, <hi>They that are after the Fleſh, doe mind the things of the fleſh,</hi> he doth not properly meane that neither.</p>
                     <p>But thirdly and laſtly, a man is ſayd to be after the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> when he is in his <hi>pure naturalls;</hi> when he <note place="margin">3. VVhen men are meerly carnall.</note> is <hi>meerly carnall,</hi> when he is <hi>wholly fleſh,</hi> when he is <hi>deſtitute</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God: when men are ſo
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53448:169"/> 
                        <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>fleſhly</hi> in their <hi>principles,</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> that there is nothing of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God in them. So it is principally to be taken here. Though for the former two, I may ſay this, that as <hi>farr</hi> as a <hi>Saint</hi> either in the meaſure of his <hi>graces,</hi> or in his <hi>actions,</hi> is <hi>Fleſhly,</hi> he minds <hi>Fleſhly</hi> things: but a man that is wholly fleſhly, wholly minds Fleſhly things. And ſo much concerning the firſt Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing is, what is meant here by the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. VVhat meant by the things of the fleſh, and of the ſpirit.</note> 
                        <hi>things</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and by the <hi>things</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit?</hi> If you remember what I have told you of <hi>Fleſh</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you will underſtand much what is meant by the things of the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> I told you <hi>Fleſh</hi> was <hi>old Adam,</hi> both in his <hi>good,</hi> and in his <hi>evill, pure Adam</hi> and <hi>corrupt Adam,</hi> and every thing that came <hi>from</hi> him, or every thing that <hi>leads</hi> to him, that was <hi>Fleſh.</hi> So the things of the fleſh are theſe <hi>things,</hi> and all <hi>opportunities</hi> belonging to them in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
                     <p>But, that you may underſtand it a little better.

                     <p>But now in perticular, I will ſumme up the things of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or of <hi>old Adam,</hi> (one or other of which <hi>Fleſhly</hi> men doe wholly <hi>mind)</hi> to theſe three heads.</p>
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:53448:172"/>
                     <p>The firſt is to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> their <hi>owne righteouſneſſe,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. To eſtabliſh mans owne righteouſneſſe</note> by the law, to procure to themſelves <hi>juſtification</hi> by their works. This is the <hi>maſter-peice</hi> of <hi>old A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> for, I told you, that man is more prone to this then to ſinne, though he be prone to that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and old <hi>Adam</hi> works <hi>ſtronger</hi> towards his <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> (ſuch as it is) in a forbidden way, then to ſinne. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Rom. 10. 3. They being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſſe, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe.</hi> He ſpeaks there of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> The word in the originall is, they went to make it <hi>ſtand;</hi> juſt as a <hi>tottered houſe</hi> that every <hi>blaſt</hi> is ready to <hi>throw</hi> downe, and it muſt be underpropped on this ſide, &amp; on that ſide to keepe it up: So every <hi>fleſhly</hi> man in the world, this is halfe his worke, to make the <hi>Babel</hi> of his owne righteouſneſſe to ſtand; he is alway pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and patching, and doing ſome good worke, he is wiſhing and woulding, or in one faſhion or other, to make up a good eſtate, againſt the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day.</hi> Therefore that was the queſtion <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and <hi>Luke</hi> 3. and it is the grand queſtion of all mankind, <hi>What ſhall we doe to be ſaved?</hi> and we ſee when they came to Chriſt, it was alway with this, <hi>Maſter, what ſhall I doe to be ſaved?</hi> As if he had ſaid, I know it muſt be by doing, and I am willing to goe about it to frame ſome kinde of <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> or other: Therefore in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. ſay they, <hi>What ſhall we doe to work the works of eternall life?</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>This is the worke of God to believe;</hi> he takes them off.</p>
                     <p>Now this is one thing whereby you may know what it is to be a <hi>fleſhly man,</hi> and to <hi>minde fleſhly</hi>
                        <pb n="331" facs="tcp:53448:172"/> 
                        <hi>things;</hi> when people mind, and caſt <hi>projects,</hi> and wayes to procure <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> to themſelves, or <hi>juſtification</hi> to their ſoules, any other way, then only by the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Men may be, as it were, drunke ſometimes, and mind neither <hi>heaven</hi> nor <hi>hell;</hi> but there is no fleſhly carnall man, when he is his owne man, but he thinks there is ſome good worke or other that he muſt <hi>doe,</hi> either gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or lending, or <hi>building</hi> an <hi>Almes-houſe,</hi> or giving to the <hi>poore,</hi> or ſomewhat to get him a <hi>righteouſnes:</hi> But remember, thou art a <hi>carnal</hi> man, and all thy <hi>minding,</hi> and all thy <hi>thoughts</hi> this way, are but according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and thoſe that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>fleſh muſt dye:</hi> it was the firſt and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt curſe that ever was in the world, when God ſaid to <hi>old Adam,</hi> he muſt dye; it is a generall rule, all <hi>old Adam</hi> muſt <hi>dye,</hi> either thou muſt get that peice of <hi>old Adam</hi> that is in thee to <hi>dye,</hi> or thou ſhalt <hi>dye</hi> with it, one of the two.</p>
                     <p>Then another thing that is called the things of <note place="margin">2 Carnall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</note> the <hi>fleſh,</hi> it is <hi>carnall priviledges,</hi> either men that are <hi>Fleſhly,</hi> mind their <hi>juſtification</hi> out of Chriſt, or elſe their carnall <hi>priviledges;</hi> I told you before that thoſe are called <hi>Fleſh,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, if any might, I may <hi>glory in the Fleſh.</hi> What is that? <hi>I am an Hebrew of the Hebrews,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Mat. 3. Joh.</hi> 8. and 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. They were apt, as to ſtabliſh their own <hi>righteouſnes,</hi> ſo, to <hi>glory</hi> in their <hi>priviledges; we are the children of Abraham, we were never ſlaves,</hi> nor <hi>Servants.</hi> We have not their <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi> to glory in, yet this is a maine piece of <hi>old Adam,</hi> a great part of the things of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges, let them be Church-priviledges,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:53448:173"/> or what you will; when people rejoyce, and <hi>mind</hi> and contemplate <hi>outward priviledges,</hi> and doe not regard the <hi>inward</hi> power, nor what is in, and <hi>through</hi> and by them, this is but fleſh.</p>
                     <p>I feare you will not beare with me, you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count me your enemy for telling you the truth: but I am perſwaded, there are many among us, that talke of <hi>churches,</hi> and <hi>government,</hi> and <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> and <hi>priviledges,</hi> and yet all is but <hi>fleſh,</hi> and you cannot well judge of them by their <hi>ſtrictneſſe</hi> in it; for <hi>fleſh</hi> will goe as <hi>ſtrictly</hi> in its way as the <hi>Spirit:</hi> but it is to be feared, that diverſe <hi>build</hi> of it, and <hi>glory</hi> in it; and it is a great part of their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> I warne you in love to looke to it, and if thoſe priviledges were taken away, as Chriſt takes away the <hi>priviledge</hi> of being the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> from the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſuch people would be poore <hi>carnall</hi> people. Take heed of it, and let him that glories, glory in the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, the things of the fleſh (for <note place="margin">3 To fulfill ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full luſts.</note> all old <hi>Adam</hi> is included in theſe three things) that fleſhly men mind, is to <hi>fulfill</hi> their <hi>luſts,</hi> which are many. <hi>To make proviſion for the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 13. that is, to be caſting how to <hi>feed</hi> one <hi>luſt</hi> or other. Now if you would know what thoſe luſts are in particular (though in a ſort it be generall) you have it in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. ſaith he, <hi>all that is in the world, is the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life.</hi> Theſe are the luſts of the world; all the luſts in the world may be reduced it ſeemes to thoſe 3. heads: ſo I ſay, theſe are the <hi>fleſhly</hi> things that al <hi>Carnall</hi> people <hi>mind:</hi> all their thoughts through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the yeare, every one runns, either in <hi>ſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                        <pb n="333" facs="tcp:53448:173"/> their own <hi>righteouſnes,</hi> or in <hi>glorying,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating their outward priviledges, or in <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting</hi> for the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of ſome <hi>luſt</hi> or other, thus they ſpend their whole life, theſe are the things of the fleſh, that carnall men mind.</p>
                     <p>Now the other, the things of the <hi>Spirit</hi> that are contrary to theſe, you may comprehend them all <note place="margin">Things of the ſpirit.</note> in three words That is,</p>
                     <p>They are either the things of <hi>faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or elſe their <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>happineſſe</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Or elſe their <hi>Obedience</hi> to the will of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>All the things of the Spirit, are comprehended in theſe three.</p>
                     <p>Either the things of faith. They mind the <note place="margin">1 The things of faith.</note> things of the Spirit; that is, they alway mind, and ſtudy how to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and how to lay <hi>firmer,</hi> and <hi>righter</hi> hold on him, how they may <hi>know</hi> him more <hi>diſtinctly,</hi> and hold him more <hi>firmly,</hi> and get fuller aſſurance, this is their worke.</p>
                     <p>Or they are excerciſed about the things of <hi>hope,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. The things they hope for by Chriſt.</note> that is, they are contemplating and rejoycing in their <hi>happineſse</hi> by Chriſt, how their <hi>perſons</hi> are <hi>juſtified,</hi> and their ſins <hi>pardoned,</hi> and the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse</hi> of the law <hi>fulfilled</hi> in them, and all in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>earth</hi> beſtowed on them. As Paul ſayth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. This is our Religion, we glory in the fleſh as if not, but <hi>we reioyce in Jeſus, we have no confidence in the fleſh,</hi> but <hi>we rejoyce in Jeſus,</hi> that is, in all the happineſſe we have in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Or thirdly, and laſtly, the things of the ſpirit <note place="margin">3 Obedience to the wil of Chriſt.</note> are the will of God, or the <hi>commands</hi> of Jeſus
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53448:174"/> Chriſt: they alway ſtudie how they may <hi>obey,</hi> and fulfill <hi>the good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.</hi> So, that a <hi>Saint,</hi> if he be <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, either acting his <hi>faith,</hi> and increaſing, and <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> that; or he is contemplating his <hi>happineſſe</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt: Or ſtudying which way to <hi>glorifie</hi> God, to know what part of the will of God, he knowes not; and to ſtudie what part of the will of God he knowes, and remembers, this is his excerciſe. And let this ſuffice to ſhew what the <hi>things</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and what the <hi>things</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> are.</p>
                     <p>Now the third queſtion breifly is, what is meant <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. VVhat meant by minding the things of the fleſh, and of the ſpirit.</note> by the <hi>minding</hi> of the things of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>things</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You muſt underſtand, firſt, that the meaning is not, as though a man might not <hi>think</hi> upon <hi>Fleſhly</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Not but that a Saint may provide out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things.</note> things. For a ſpirituall Saint oft thinks upon <hi>Fleſhly</hi> things in a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> manner, as to conſider <hi>his</hi> ſins, to bewayle, and to <hi>mourne</hi> for them: and he may mind, Earthly, Worldly things, to <hi>provide things honeſt,</hi> to provide for his <hi>Familie,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith; he may think of his buſineſſe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Ghoſt here doth not uſe the word <hi>Frouneſis,</hi> but <hi>Frounena, Frouneſis</hi> ſignifies <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> or <hi>diſcretion,</hi> or <hi>providence</hi> in buſineſſe. He doth not uſe that, leaſt we ſhould think that the holy Ghoſt forbids to <hi>provide,</hi> to be <hi>mindfull,</hi> and <hi>carefull</hi> of Worldly buſineſſe, but <hi>Frounena,</hi> that ſignifies a further thing, as I ſhall ſhew preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Now then you muſt underſtand this alſo, <note place="margin">2. The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is not only meant.</note> that when the Apoſtle ſayth, they <hi>mind the things of the Fleſh.</hi> The word doth not onely ſignifie the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53448:174"/> 
                        <hi>underſtanding,</hi> but it ſignifies all the <hi>affections</hi> alſo. I could give you divers places of Scripture where this <hi>word</hi> is ſet downe to expreſſe the working of any <hi>affection</hi> in the ſoule. Therefore the meaning is not only of the <hi>mind</hi> that <hi>ſtudies:</hi> but his <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> his will, the way of his <hi>delight,</hi> his <hi>joy</hi> is in <hi>earthly</hi> things; his care is after fleſhly things.</p>
                     <p>But in particuler, there are theſe four or five <note place="margin">Five things meant by minding of fleſhly things</note> things implied in the word, when they are ſaid to <hi>mind the things of the Fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that the very <hi>care</hi> of his heart (as <note place="margin">1. The ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e of the heart is fleſhly.</note> I told you before) is <hi>Fleſhly,</hi> and carnall. A Chriſtian hath outward <hi>VVorldly</hi> things in an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Roome, and Jeſus Chriſt next his heart. There is (ſayth one godly man) a <hi>cloſet</hi> in the heart of a Saint, onely to <hi>entertaine Jeſus Christ.</hi> Which the Scripture calls the <hi>ſpirit</hi> frequently: <hi>I worſhip God in my ſpirit: Rom.</hi> 1. And in 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. That ye may be ſanctified in your ſpirit.</hi> That is, in the very <hi>Coare,</hi> and <hi>quinteſſence</hi> of the ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Now a godly man may have many hurries of <hi>VVordly</hi> things, and <hi>lusts</hi> croſs and come through, but the <hi>coare</hi> of his heart is for <hi>God,</hi> and for <hi>holines.</hi> Therefore ſaith Paul. <hi>Rom. 7. I ſerve the law of the fleſh with my members, and the law of Chriſt with my mind.</hi> That is, <hi>inwardly,</hi> with the <hi>care</hi> of my <hi>heart:</hi> I ſhewed the meaning of that word before, I ſhall not now goe on further in that.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a man is ſayd to <hi>mind</hi> worldly things <note place="margin">2. VVhen a man ſavours fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things.</note> when a man not only <hi>thinks</hi> of Worldly, and <hi>fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> things, but <hi>ſavours</hi> of worldly and <hi>Fleſhly</hi> things: Therefore the ſame word <hi>Frounena,</hi> that is here <hi>minding,</hi> is oft read to <hi>ſavour.</hi> As in the Speech
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53448:175"/> of Chriſt to <hi>Peter, Thou ſavoureſt the things of the VVorld,</hi> thou haſt a <hi>ſmack</hi> of it, thou haſt a <hi>reliſh</hi> of carnall things. So then to <hi>mind Fleſhly</hi> things, is when a man not only <hi>thinks</hi> of them, and <hi>conſiders</hi> them, but when a man finds moſt <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>taſt,</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in ſuch kind of things. Put a <hi>Fleſhly</hi> man about <hi>Worldly,</hi> or <hi>carnall,</hi> or if you will about <hi>ſinful</hi> buſineſſe: O there he is as a <hi>fiſh</hi> in the <hi>VVater,</hi> there he is his <hi>owne</hi> man, he is well; but put him about any ſpirituall thing, let him come to <hi>learne</hi> a little for his <hi>ſoule;</hi> or let his Neighbour come to <hi>teach</hi> him, and <hi>admoniſh,</hi> and <hi>reproove</hi> him, he is upon <hi>thornes</hi> then, he hath no <hi>tast</hi> of it at all: now if thou be a <hi>Fleſhly</hi> man thou <hi>mindeſt</hi> Fleſhly things, that is, thou doeſt not onely in thy <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> conſider of them, but thy ſoule <hi>reliſheth</hi> them; there thou art thy <hi>owne</hi> man, when thou art in the <hi>middest</hi> of the <hi>VVorld,</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> and <hi>hell:</hi> therefore looke to thy ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to <hi>mind</hi> Fleſhly things, is when the <note place="margin">3. When the ſtreame of the ſoule goes that way.</note> 
                        <hi>ſtreame,</hi> the <hi>maine</hi> of the ſoule goes upon Fleſhly, earthly, <hi>carnall</hi> things; when the things of God are but <hi>by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> buſineſſe to a man. It is not ſo in a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. He <hi>uſeth the world as if he uſed it not,</hi> he minds little of the World, as little as may be, but the maine <hi>ſtreame</hi> of his <hi>ſoule</hi> is upon Jeſus Chriſt, there he <hi>excerciſeth himſelfe day and night,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, when a man doth <hi>ſtudie</hi> and <hi>plod</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <note place="margin">4. To ſtudie and plod for fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things.</note> upon Worldly things, upon <hi>Fleſhly</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things. When a man takes <hi>care,</hi> for ſo the word is uſed oft in Scripture, as it is uſed. <hi>Rom. 14. 6. If any man doth obſerve a day,</hi> or care for a
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53448:175"/> day, <hi>Curare diem,</hi> as we read it in the Latine, if one <hi>obſerve</hi> it, and another will not, or will not <hi>regard</hi> it. When a man <hi>obſerves</hi> and <hi>regards,</hi> and takes <hi>care,</hi> and <hi>ſtudies,</hi> and <hi>plods</hi> for <hi>earthly,</hi> Fleſhly things, this is to mind Fleſhly things. Therefore in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>I am glad that your care is renewed towards me;</hi> ſaith <hi>B E Z A,</hi> it is more then care, there is a kind of ſollicitude, it is <hi>addice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re animam,</hi> it is a word that ſignifies when a man <hi>addicts</hi> himſelfe, when he is <hi>given wholly</hi> to a thing; when a man is <hi>addicted,</hi> and gives his <hi>mind</hi> wholly to the World, to <hi>fulfill</hi> his <hi>luſts,</hi> or to <hi>enjoy</hi> his <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> this is to <hi>mind</hi> Fleſhly things.</p>
                     <p>Then fiftly, and laſtly, it is when a man, doth <hi>judg</hi> of things according to the Fleſh. <hi>Non eſt Cogitare, &amp;c.</hi> To mind is not only to <hi>think</hi> of it, but to <hi>judge</hi> of things. As you have it 2 <hi>Cor. 5. I judge no man according to the fleſh.</hi> If Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus were here againe, I would not looke on him according to the Fleſh. Now when he ſaith, <hi>they mind the things of the fleſh,</hi> this is the meaning of it, that is, they <hi>judge</hi> of things in an earthly <hi>fleſhly</hi> way, they judge of the worth of things by the <hi>fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe</hi> not by the <hi>ſpirituallneſſe</hi> of them. A godly <note place="margin">How godly men judge of things.</note> man doth not ſo, all that he <hi>accounts</hi> of in the World, are the <hi>things</hi> of God, and of the <hi>ſpirit;</hi> were it not for that, this <hi>World</hi> would be a <hi>Hell</hi> to him: and he <hi>judgeth</hi> of every man as he hath the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God, he accounts of him as <hi>without</hi> that, not <hi>worth</hi> any thing; a <hi>carnall</hi> man <hi>judgeth</hi> of things <hi>carnally,</hi> as they are <hi>fleſhly,</hi> and <hi>carnall,</hi> and as <hi>old Adam</hi> is ſet up; ſo he judgeth by carnall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things. Thus I have as
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:53448:176"/> breifly as I could, opened the meaning of it. I will only at this time name one Uſe, and leave the reſt till God give another opportunitie.</p>
                     <p>You have heard what it is to be <hi>after the fleſh,</hi> and what the <hi>things</hi> of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and the things of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> are; and what it is to <hi>mind</hi> the things of the <hi>fleſh</hi> and the things of the <hi>ſpirit:</hi> for we may judge of the one by the other.</p>
                     <p>Now the Leſſon, or the Uſe (as we call it) is <note place="margin">
                           <hi>uſe.</hi> 1. VVhy moſt people under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things.</note> this. Hence we may learne and ſee what the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, why diverſe people notwithſtanding all the meanes uſed, even among us in this place, and in other places, why they cannot come to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi> any thing of Heavenly things; of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things. What is the reaſon? Becauſe they <hi>mind</hi> them not, and why doe they not <hi>mind</hi> them? Becauſe they are <hi>fleſhly.</hi> I have wondred oft times, and I doe beleive in my Conſcience that had I been here but a twelve month, and had taken any naturall thing under Heaven, had I read a Lecture of <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> or of <hi>Logick,</hi> or any thing in your <hi>Trades,</hi> or <hi>State</hi> buſineſſe, there are none eyther <hi>great</hi> or <hi>ſmall,</hi> but could have given ſome account what the man had ſayd: and yet there are ſome among you that though we have been ſpeaking to you as the Lord hath enabled us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt theſe two yeares, yet you are as <hi>ignorant,</hi> and as <hi>unknowing</hi> in any thing that hath been ſaid, as if you had been <hi>a ſleepe,</hi> or had been in your <hi>Graves</hi> all the while. It is a wonderfull thing that <hi>no</hi> word ſhould ſtick, <hi>nothing</hi> in the world of all that hath been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>If we ſhould ask ſome among us, doe you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53448:176"/> any <hi>one paſſage,</hi> or any <hi>one thing,</hi> that the Preacher hath ſpoken of theſe two yeares? they remember not one word. What is the reaſon? You did not mind it: that is the meaning of that word, <hi>Seeing they ſee not, and hearing they heare not;</hi> that was the plague upon that people in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> When a mans mind is taken up with other things, a man may ride by the <hi>doore,</hi> and one may ſay, did you ſee ſuch a man? he came by your <hi>eye;</hi> I ſaw him not ſayth he, <hi>ſeeing</hi> he <hi>ſaw not;</hi> his <hi>eye</hi> was on him, but <hi>his</hi> mind was not, he was <hi>thinking</hi> ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of ſomething elſe; ſo, hearing, they heare not. Many times a man heares a ſound, and is neare enough, yet hearing he heares not, ſo it is with many among us, the Lord pittie them, my heart is readie to burſt every day, more, and more to conſider, and think of it; hearing they heare not all the yeare long, there is not <hi>one notion,</hi> or exhortation from the word that <hi>ſticks</hi> on their ſoules; the reaſon is, they <hi>mind</hi> not, they <hi>mind</hi> the things of the Fleſh, they are <hi>feeding</hi> ſome <hi>luſt,</hi> they are <hi>providing</hi> for ſome <hi>fancie,</hi> or when they are beſt they are contemplating to <hi>ſet up</hi> a way of <hi>juſtification</hi> by <hi>works, and</hi> all becauſe they <hi>mind</hi> not theſe things. Therefore ſaith the Lord, <hi>I ſay 1.

                     <p>And this is the reaſon alſo, why you have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <note place="margin">VVhy people care not for Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> people that care not for the <hi>ordinances</hi> of God, they care not to uſe thoſe meanes of grace, that the <hi>poor</hi> Saints doe; why, they mind not <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> things, they are like <hi>Gallio,</hi> he <hi>cared not for thoſe things;</hi> he was buſie about <hi>naturall</hi> things.

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53448:177"/> thy <hi>table,</hi> of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things, thou art like <hi>Gallio,</hi> thou careſt not for them, and therefore thou reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteſt them not.</p>
                     <p>Therfore deſire the Lord to put his Law in thy <hi>mind.</hi> O! the maine miſery of a man is in his mind, the man is nothing but his mind in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the maine <hi>happineſſe</hi> of a man is in his mind, if the Law of God be there. Therefore, before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou canſt have thy <hi>heart</hi> good, or thy <hi>wiſhes</hi> or prayers good, thou muſt get a good mind, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God to put his Law in thy mind, for there is the firſt, and maine worke.</p>
                     <p>So alſo for the poore <hi>Saint;</hi> this is the reaſon <note place="margin">VVhy the Saints take injuries pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.</note> why the people of God are ſo <hi>weaned</hi> from the <hi>world;</hi> thoſe that are ſpirituall Chriſtians, you can eaſily <hi>cozen</hi> and <hi>cheat</hi> them, and take away all from them, and they beare it very well: Why ſo? they <hi>mind not</hi> earthly things, fleſhly things. Let the <hi>Devill</hi> come with all the <hi>policie,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of hell to <hi>cheat</hi> them in ſpirituall things, to take away their <hi>peace,</hi> and crack their <hi>communion</hi> with God, they will ſee, &amp; be wiſe, and reſiſt; but come and <hi>cheat</hi> them in worldly things, poore creatures they are quiet, and part with them: as it is the manner of many of you that are <hi>rotten Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> and ſelf-ſeekes, you make it a trade to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe them, but they are quiet, they mind ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things: As a cut-purſe that comes into your ſhop, and a man minds other things, he may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>steale:</hi> So the poore <hi>Saints</hi> are made <hi>poore</hi> and <hi>ſuffering,</hi> becauſe they <hi>mind</hi> God, and <hi>heavenly</hi> things; or elſe I tell you, if their minds were not imployed elſewhere, a Saint could be as cunning,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:53448:178"/> and as wiſe, and worldly as thou: but thou mayſt eaſily ſteale any thing from him, and <hi>cheat,</hi> and <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> him, becauſe his mind is upon other things, it is upon <hi>heaven,</hi> and thoſe bleſſed things.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former Verſe I told you <note place="margin">The ſcope of the Apoſtle.</note> the Apoſtle holds forth unto us a great <hi>priviledge:</hi> the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> that I know that a man can have, <hi>that the righteouſneſſe of the law might be fullfilled in us.</hi> For it doth <hi>protect</hi> a man from all <hi>evills;</hi> for all <hi>evill</hi> is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon this, that a man hath <hi>not</hi> a <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>law:</hi> and he that hath this <hi>priviledg</hi> it doth <hi>lead</hi> him to the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of all <hi>good:</hi> for if a man hath a <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> to <hi>fulfill</hi> the law, then there is nothing that can keepe the <hi>Creature</hi> from a full <hi>enjoyment</hi> of his <hi>Creator.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this priviledg being ſo great, the Apoſtle
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:53448:179"/> ſhews us <hi>who</hi> they are that are <hi>Partakers</hi> of it, who have the <hi>actuall</hi> enjoyment of it: for the worſt Fleſhly carnall man, may <hi>come</hi> to be a <hi>Partaker:</hi> but he ſhewes who are for the <hi>preſent,</hi> and ſaith he, they are <hi>thoſe that walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> That is a <hi>ſure</hi> way to know, and diſtinguiſh them, but it is a <hi>generall</hi> way; and therefore the Apoſtle drawes downe ſome <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars</hi> from this <hi>generall,</hi> that are more <hi>known,</hi> and eaſie to be <hi>diſcerned.</hi> As in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 1. You ſhall ſee there the ſame kind of reaſoning, ſayth the Apoſtle, <hi>Whoſoever beleiveth that Jeſus is Chriſt, is borne of God.</hi> How ſhall we know that we doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive? <hi>Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him.</hi> How ſhall we know that we <hi>love God?</hi> we <hi>love</hi> them that are <hi>begotten</hi> of God? How ſhall we know that we <hi>love them</hi> that are <hi>borne</hi> of God? If we <hi>love God, and keepe his commandements.</hi> And how ſhall we know that we <hi>keepe his commandements?</hi> They are not <hi>greivious,</hi> and ſo he goes from a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to a more particular thing. So the Apoſtle in this place, after he had given a generall, he comes more particularly to ſhew it. <hi>They that are after the fleſh, doe mind the things of the fleſh, but they that are after the ſpirit doe mind the things of the ſpirit.</hi> As if he had ſaid, if you doe not know whether you <hi>walk</hi> in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> or in the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> I will ſhew you, I will inſtance in one thing, I will pitch <note place="margin">The beſtthing in a carnall man is his mind.</note> upon the <hi>beſt</hi> thing that is in a <hi>naturall</hi> man, and that is his <hi>mind;</hi> I will inſtance but in that; for you may know the <hi>Lion</hi> by his <hi>Paw,</hi> you may know the <hi>man</hi> by his <hi>mind,</hi> for he that is <hi>fleſhly,</hi>
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:53448:179"/> 
                        <hi>minds Fleſhly things.</hi> As if he had ſaid, if the mind of a <hi>man</hi> (which is his beſt thing) be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about Fleſhly things, then his <hi>will</hi> is ſo, and his <hi>affections,</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> are ſo. And if the <hi>mind</hi> of a man be upon <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things, then his <hi>will</hi> is ſo, his <hi>affections,</hi> his <hi>actions,</hi> his whole <hi>life</hi> is ſo. This is the drift, and ſcope of the Apoſtle. Now the Leſſon we had in hand the laſt time from the words, it was I told you the ſame with the Text here: that
<q>
                           <p>Thoſe that are after, or walke after the fleſh, they doe mind fleſhly things, and thoſe that are after the Spirit, doe mind ſpirituall things.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I gave you <hi>two reaſons</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>I opened it by anſwering <hi>three Questions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I came to make ſome uſe of it, and finiſhed only one, which was to ſee the reaſon why <hi>carnall</hi> Fleſhly people, doe <hi>know</hi> ſo <hi>little</hi> of the <hi>things of God,</hi> though they have ſo much <hi>meanes,</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> and have <hi>time</hi> to enjoy them, and have <hi>Eares</hi> to heare, and <hi>Books</hi> to read, and yet they <hi>know</hi> nothing of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things, the reaſon is, becauſe they <hi>mind them not.</hi> But I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                     <p>Another word is this, from this way, and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi>

                           <hi>Uſe.</hi> 2.

                        <pb n="346" facs="tcp:53448:180"/> of a Chriſtian, the <hi>choiceſt</hi> peice that is in a Chriſtian, is the <hi>ſpiritualneſſe</hi> of his <hi>mind:</hi> ſo the <hi>worſt</hi> peice in a <hi>carnall</hi> man is the <hi>fleſhlyneſſe</hi> of his <hi>mind.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle doth pitch upon the <hi>worſt</hi> peice to demonſtrate the reſt, <hi>he that is after the fleſh minds fleſhly things.</hi> As if he had ſaid, you may eaſily gueſs at the <hi>rest,</hi> if the <hi>mind</hi> be naught. You are wonderfully miſtaken when you ſee a little of your miſery <hi>you complaine,</hi> O, I have a <hi>weak memory:</hi> when I am hearing ſpirituall things I think they are <hi>written</hi> upon my heart, but I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently forget it, and I am <hi>paſſionate, &amp;c.</hi> And that is all my fault. O, but here is the <hi>root,</hi> thou haſt a <hi>fleſhly mind,</hi> and therefore there are <hi>fleſhly thoughts</hi> and fleſhly <hi>actions,</hi> all proceed from that.</p>
                     <p>The mind of a man is either the cheifeſt <hi>Seat</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, it is <hi>blind,</hi> that is, it is <hi>darkeneſſe,</hi> that is the word in <hi>Epheſ. 5. 8. For ye were ſomtimes dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi>

                        <hi>Vaine</hi> ſignifies <hi>empty</hi> in Scripture, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaw all things under the Sun that they were</hi>

                        <hi>vaine;</hi> that is, they are <hi>empty,</hi> they have no <hi>good</hi> in them. So if thou be a <hi>carnall</hi> man, thy mind is vaine, that is, it is <hi>empty</hi> of all good; there are none of thoſe ſweet <hi>meditations,</hi> and <hi>contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſiderations</hi> of <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> it is quite <hi>emptie.</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>thou ſhalt not call thy Brother Racha,</hi> that is, <hi>emptie,</hi> but thou mayſt ſay ſo of thy <hi>minde,</hi> thou mayſt ſay I have an <hi>empty</hi> minde, a <hi>minde</hi> that is <hi>Racha,</hi> that is, <hi>emptie.</hi> Therefore ſaith <hi>Solomon, The words of the godly are as choyce ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but the heart of the wicked is little worth:</hi> as one godly man ſaith, his very heart is not worth a <hi>half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peny:</hi> ſo I may ſay of al thy thoughts, that art yet in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> all thy thoughts through the yeare are not worth one <hi>farthing.</hi>

Well, what ſaith the Apoſtle? <hi>As they did not like to retaine God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind,</hi> &amp;c. A mind voyd of <hi>judgement,</hi> as it is in your Margine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had a little knowledge and regarded it not, God gave them up to a <hi>reprobate minde,</hi> to a <hi>mind</hi> voyd of <hi>judgement,</hi> that is, ſuch a mind as never ſhould have the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God any more: you ſhall know no more, you are troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that you have a little knowledge of God; ſaith God, I will take away your judgement, and you ſhall know no more.</p>

If thou compare it with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 2. <hi>Thou doſt ſet thy heart as the heart of God;</hi> there is no carnall man, but he thinks he is as God, he thinks he knoweth all things: that a man which is a <hi>mad</hi> man, that is <hi>wild</hi> and hath no knowledg, yet notwithſtanding, that he ſhould conceive that he is <hi>wiſe</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> as full of <hi>knowledge</hi> as God is in a maner; this is the thought that is in the hearts of men; and therefore you ſhall ſee in that place, verſe 9. ſaith the Lord, <hi>Wilt thou yet ſay before him that ſlayeth thee, I am God?</hi> Not that men ſay ſo with their Tongues, but in their hearts, that they are <hi>wiſe</hi> as God.

Therefore to conclude, this is my meaning, that all that are Profeſſors in this <hi>ſelf-ſeeking age,</hi> wherein one may goe with a Candle (as the Prophet ſaith) through Jeruſalem: a man may goe with a Candle from <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi> to the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> to looke for a man that <hi>naturally minds</hi> the things of <hi>God,</hi> and the people of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> of God, and the like. And if they be ſo ſcarce I beſeech you conſider what a fearfull thing it is?
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:53448:185"/> and how the holy Ghoſt ſets it out here, that <hi>their end is deſtruction,</hi> and Paule ſpeaks of it <hi>weeping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Therefore let it be thy worke now to looke to thy <hi>mind,</hi> though thou profeſs to be a Saint, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>naturall</hi> to thee to <hi>care</hi> for thy <hi>ſelfe,</hi> but to doe for <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>now,</hi> and <hi>then;</hi> and it may be after many perſwaſions thou mayeſt be brought to doe ſomthing for <hi>God,</hi> and for the <hi>people</hi> of God: but it is <hi>naturall</hi> to thee to look to thy <hi>ſelfe,</hi> and to thine owne <hi>honour,</hi> and thy owne <hi>place,</hi> and <hi>preferment,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord helpe thee to looke to this.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>That we may find, whether we walke after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> or after the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> I would urge it a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that according to the Apoſtles method. He pitcheth upon the mind, and the mind not <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> conſidered, but as it is <hi>acting,</hi> and <hi>ſetting forth, the mind,</hi> in <hi>minding:</hi> therefore as he takes the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt facultie to judge the reſt by, ſo I will take the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53448:186"/> chiefeſt act in that facultie, that ſo you may judge of the reſt by that one, and ſo keep to the Apoſtles method.</p>
                     <p>Now the chiefeſt act of the mind (doubtleſſe) <note place="margin">The chiefe act of the mind.</note> is the <hi>reaſoning</hi> part of the mind. There are many acts in the mind; as it underſtands, it thinks, it <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magines;</hi> but eſpecially the <hi>reaſoning part,</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the mind to reaſon concerning things, and <hi>reaſon</hi> is the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> part, and is called, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by Schollers the chiefeſt part of man; and therefore they ſay, that man is a reaſonable creature: Now I ſay, if we will find out by the Scriptures, what we are, whether we be according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> or according to the <hi>ſpirit</hi> (for there is the hinge of it) we muſt examine it by the <hi>mind;</hi> &amp; not by the mind <hi>ſimply,</hi> as it is a <hi>faculty,</hi> but the mind <hi>acting,</hi> and <hi>exerciſing.</hi> And if we ſpeak of the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of it, let us take the <hi>reaſoning</hi> part of it, that is he beſt part, for of all the acts of the mind, the <hi>reaſoning</hi> is the <hi>ſtrongeſt,</hi> and that that moſt <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly</hi> flowes from the <hi>underſtanding:</hi> therefore if the <hi>reaſoning</hi> of the ſoule be <hi>carnall,</hi> the whole <hi>ſoule</hi> is ſo, and if the reaſoning of it be <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> the whole <hi>ſoule</hi> is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> that was one thing that did move me to pitch upon that, it being the chiefeſt.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, I find that the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. <note place="margin">How <hi>Paul</hi> diſtinguiſheth Saints and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> he diſtinguiſheth thoſe that walke according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> from thoſe that walke according to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> by the <hi>reaſoning</hi> part, for ſaith he, <hi>Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know we no man after the fleſh, yea though we have knowne Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.</hi> We doe not ſaith he, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth <hi>walke</hi> according to the <hi>fleſh;</hi> and we <hi>know</hi> it
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53448:186"/> by our knowledge, we do know things, <hi>not</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> but according to the <hi>ſpirit;</hi> if Chriſt himſelfe were here, we would not looke upon him with a fleſhly eye. What this <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is,</hi> you may ſee in the verſes before: <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge,</hi> we thus <hi>reaſon, that if one dyed for all, then were all dead, and that he dyed for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which dyed for them, and roſe againe.</hi> We <hi>know</hi> ſaith he, that we are <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and not fleſhly, by our <hi>judging</hi> of things, by our <hi>reaſoning</hi> of things: for thus we <hi>judge,</hi> or thus we <hi>reaſon,</hi> that if one man dyed for all, that is, did dye for others, then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we all are <hi>dead:</hi> And we reaſon further, that if one man did dye for us, and we are ſuffered to live, we ſhould imploy our life, not for our ſelves but for him that dyed for us. This kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning we have, that walke after the Spirit, and not after the Fleſh, therefore I will pitch upon that. And the rather, becauſe the Lord hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for ends beſt knowne to him, to keep that in my mind, and to fix it ſo on my thoughts, that I could not paſſe it by, and I uſually judge in ſuch caſes that God doth often doe it for your ſakes.</p>
                     <p>And therefore according to this method, wee ſhall obſerve this Doctrine, or this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>For ſuch as the <hi>mind</hi> is, ſo is the whole <hi>man,</hi> and if your <hi>reaſoning</hi> be <hi>right,</hi> then I dare ſay that all the <hi>acts</hi> of your <hi>mind</hi> are <hi>right:</hi> for that is the <hi>cheifeſt,</hi> you may <hi>judge</hi> of all the <hi>acts</hi> of your <hi>mind</hi> by your <hi>reaſoning:</hi> and therefore we cull out <hi>that</hi> for the triall of the <hi>reſt.</hi> I ſay <hi>carnall</hi> men are <hi>ſwayed,</hi> and <hi>led,</hi> with <hi>fleſhly reaſonings,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall</hi> men with <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reaſonings. And this is the moſt <hi>distinguiſhing</hi> Character that I know in the Booke of God, betweene a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>another</hi> man.</p>
                     <p>And as the Lord preſents it unto me I ſhall a little open unto you theſe termes, <hi>reaſoning, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall reaſoning,</hi> and <hi>fleſhly reaſoning.</hi> That you may underſtand theſe, you muſt conceive that there are three ſorts of <hi>mindes</hi> in the World: and therefore there be three ſorts of <hi>reaſonings:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Three ſorts of minds.</note> For our <hi>Reaſonings</hi> are according as the <hi>minde</hi> is.</p>
                     <p>There is firſt, a <hi>corrupt</hi> mind, as you have it <note place="margin">1. Corrupt.</note> 
                        <hi>Epheſ. 4. The old man that is corrupt,</hi> that is (to ſpeake in your language, or according to your thoughts) a <hi>ſinfull</hi> mind, a <hi>mind</hi> that is <hi>exerciſed</hi>
                        <pb n="361" facs="tcp:53448:187"/> about <hi>ſinfull</hi> things. When a mans <hi>mind</hi> is an <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> one, ſimplie evill.</p>
                     <p>Secondly there is a <hi>naturall</hi> mind, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. at <note place="margin">2. Naturall.</note> the latter end, it is called there, the <hi>naturall man.</hi> where I would have you obſerve by the bye, that the <hi>mind</hi> is called the <hi>man</hi> there, the naturall <hi>man,</hi> that is, the naturall <hi>mind. The naturall man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the things of God;</hi> that is, the <hi>naturall mind,</hi> for a <hi>man</hi> is denominated by his <hi>excellenteſt</hi> part, which is his <hi>mind,</hi> as I told you before.</p>
                     <p>And there is alſo the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> mind, which is <note place="margin">3. Spirituall.</note> called there, the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> man. <hi>The ſpirituall man judgeth all things;</hi> that is, the <hi>ſpirituall mind</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, for it is the <hi>mind</hi> properly that doth judge, and the <hi>man</hi> is ſaid to <hi>judge,</hi> becauſe he hath the <hi>mind,</hi> or the <hi>mind</hi> is in the man: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">Three ſorts of reaſonings.</note> to theſe three ſorts of <hi>minds,</hi> flow forth; ſorts of <hi>reaſonings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One is; <hi>corrupt reaſoning,</hi> and that is, when men <note place="margin">1. Corrupt,</note> doe <hi>reaſon</hi> meerly <hi>ſinfully,</hi> according to that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. The Apoſtle uſeth their carnall phraſe, <hi>Let us eate and drinke for tomorrow we ſhall die.</hi> Now here was a kind of <hi>reaſoning</hi> in this, here was an <hi>argument,</hi> to <hi>morrow</hi> we expect to <hi>die,</hi> that is, <hi>ſhortly,</hi> therefore let us <hi>eat,</hi> and <hi>drinke,</hi> and <hi>feed</hi> our <hi>luſts, &amp;c.</hi> Here was a <hi>reaſoning,</hi> but it was <hi>corrupt.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. When they had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Servants</hi> that came to gather the rents. Now ſay they, the <hi>Heire is come, come let us kill him and then the Land will be ours.</hi> Here was reaſoning, but it was corrupt reaſoning. So in <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 44. there the diſciples did reaſon <hi>Who ſhould be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in the kingdom of God.</hi> There are ſuch reaſonings
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53448:188"/> in our hearts: for <hi>man</hi> is called a <hi>rationall</hi> man; and though ſome men be called <hi>unreaſonable</hi> men (as I ſhall ſhew by and by) yet there is <hi>no man</hi> but hath <hi>reaſonings</hi> in him, either <hi>corrupt,</hi> or <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,</hi> or <hi>ſpirituall.</hi> There is <hi>no act</hi> that a man doth, but there is ſuch a <hi>nimbleneſse</hi> in the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> that it preſently drawes ſome <hi>argument</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> for it: a man never doth any thing but he hath ſome kind of <hi>reaſon</hi> for it, be it what it will be.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is a naturall reaſoning, and <note place="margin">2 Naturall.</note> that we oft find in the Scriptures, as in <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. 6. Chriſt had there told a <hi>Leper</hi> that he had <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given</hi> him his <hi>ſins,</hi> the Scribes ſitting there, reaſon in their hearts, <hi>Why doth this man ſpeake blaſphemy? who can forgive ſins but God.</hi> This was not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>corrupt</hi> reaſoning; it was <hi>true reaſoning. Who can forgive ſins but God?</hi> This <hi>man</hi> forgives ſins, therefore it is <hi>blaſphemie;</hi> they reaſoned <hi>right,</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> as farr as <hi>naturall</hi> light could goe, but here is the difference betweene <hi>naturall,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall light, naturall</hi> light comes too <hi>ſhort,</hi> they did not ſee that he was <hi>God. None can forgive ſins but God,</hi> but they ſaw him <hi>not</hi> to be God. This was <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> reaſoning. Why? becauſe it was <hi>true</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their <hi>principle,</hi> had he been but a meere <hi>man</hi> they had <hi>reaſoned</hi> very <hi>well:</hi> but it was <hi>naturall</hi> becauſe it was <hi>lame,</hi> and <hi>low,</hi> and did not riſe up ſo high as to ſee that that <hi>man</hi> was <hi>God,</hi> and could <hi>forgive</hi> ſins. So Peters reaſoning was rather natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall then corrupt. <hi>Master ſpare thy ſelfe:</hi> it was naturall, and not corrupt reaſoning: becauſe it is good for a Servant to give good <hi>counſell</hi> to his
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:53448:188"/> Maſter. But this was but <hi>naturall:</hi> becauſe though it were <hi>honeſt,</hi> in a naturall way, yet it was <hi>lame,</hi> it wanted a <hi>principle</hi> that was <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> to ſee that it was needfull, and neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould die (according to the counſell of God) rather then that all the elect ſhould periſh.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, there are <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reaſonings. As <note place="margin">3. Spirituall.</note> there is a <hi>ſpirituall mind;</hi> ſo I ſay there are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <hi>reaſonings</hi> in all godlineſſe. For all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and every peice of it (as I ſhall ſhew) is carried upon <hi>reaſon,</hi> only it is ſpirituall reaſon. Looke upon the whole bulk of godlineſſe, you may divide it into three parts. It conſiſts,
<list>
                           <item>Either in <hi>beleiving,</hi> and <hi>doing.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>Or in obedience, and <hi>doing.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>Or in <hi>ſuffering,</hi> and <hi>doing.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>All a Chriſtians life is ſpent, either in <hi>beleiving,</hi> or in <hi>doing,</hi> or in <hi>ſuffering.</hi> Now in all theſe three you ſhall ſee in Scripture that a Saint doth not all theſe hand over head, as being led by a <hi>fancie</hi> of them, but clearly upon <hi>reaſon,</hi> and the beſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World, as I ſhall ſhew you anon.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for <hi>beleiving,</hi> looke to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is <note place="margin">1. Spirituall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving.</note> our patterne, our coppie. In <hi>Heb. 11. 19. By faith Abraham when he was tried, offered up Iſaak, and he that had received the promiſes offered up his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten ſon: of whome it was ſaid, that in Iſaak ſhall thy ſeed be called, accounting that God was able to rayſe him up from the dead,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Accounting,</hi> or as the Greeke word is, <hi>reaſoning,</hi> that <hi>God was able to rayſe him from the dead, from whence he received him</hi>
                        <pb n="364" facs="tcp:53448:189"/> 
                        <hi>in a figure.</hi> It is ſaid that by faith <hi>Abraham</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Iſaac,</hi> his onely ſon, he that had received the promiſe, God had made the promiſe to <hi>Iſaac; In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed he called. Iſaac</hi> was his ſon, and a ſon that he had in a ſtrong way, by an ancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Woman, and his onely ſon, and a ſon of whome the Meſſias ſhould come. Now there muſt be a great deale of <hi>reaſon</hi> to perſwade ſuch a godly Father to kill ſuch a hopefull Child, to put him to death, to whome God had given the promiſe of all bleſſings, to all Nations. Surely there muſt be a great deale of <hi>reaſoning</hi> before he could be perſwaded to doe this, and yet he did <hi>reaſon</hi> that God was <hi>able to raiſe him from the dead.</hi> The word <hi>reaſoning</hi> in the Greeke is a word ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Arithmetitians, that take two or three Sums, and put them together, and tell you this is the reſult of them: ſo he did <hi>reaſon,</hi> this is my ſon, and all my hopes lie in him, and I received him when I was as a dead man, and for me to goe, and kill him, will daſh all the hopes of my ſalvation. But on the other ſide, <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reaſon comes in, and ſaith, that God that gave him me in a figure from the dead, that is, as it were from a dead wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and when I was an old man, that God is able of his aſhes, when I have killed him, and burned him, to raiſe him up againe, and therefore I will goe, and Sacrifice him, and thence it is, that the holy Ghoſt ſaith, that <hi>God raiſed him fron the dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beloved, there is nothing that ſeems to be more <hi>without reaſon</hi> then Faith, and in faith there is nothing ſeemes to be more without reaſon,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:53448:189"/> then for a man to go, and kill his Son, his only Son, and yet he <hi>reaſoned,</hi> is ſaid it. And ſo in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. he looked not upon <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi> but reaſoned from that promiſe, <hi>So ſhall thy ſeed be,</hi> What was that? God called him out in a cleare night, and ſhewed him the Stars in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſaid, <hi>ſo ſhall thy ſeed be,</hi> and he <hi>reaſoned,</hi> and <hi>ſtaggered not,</hi> but looked upon God as one that was able to bring it to paſſe, and therefore it is ſaid, in <hi>hope,</hi> above <hi>hope,</hi> he believed.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall I ſpeake of <hi>Moſes?</hi> you have it in that Chapter, they ſay, old men are twice chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but <hi>Moſes being 40. yeares old, refuſed to be called the Sonne of Pharaohs daughter:</hi> ſome might thinke what a madneſſe this was? the text gives the reaſon, he <hi>reaſoned,</hi> or he, <hi>Eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt, greater riches, then the Treaſures in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> that is, he reaſoned thus, here I am in great honour, I may be called the Sonne of the Kings Daughter, and here I have <hi>hunting</hi> and <hi>hawking,</hi> and <hi>riches,</hi> &amp;c, and yonder are the poore people of God making <hi>brick,</hi> and there they have <hi>burdens</hi> laid upon them every day, and are ſighing, and groaning, and making ſpirituall prayers, and ſaith he, the <hi>bleſsing</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is there, and theſe <hi>riches</hi> are but for a time, and there are the riches that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding, and bleſſed, and therefore ſaith the text, <hi>He choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the People of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon.</hi> Thus you ſee in theſe inſtances that <hi>faith</hi> goes all upon <hi>reaſon,</hi> upon ſpirituall reaſon. <note place="margin">2. In doing</note>

                     <p>And ſo for <hi>doing;</hi> for obedience as it refers to <hi>doing,</hi> I will give you that one place, that I had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:53448:190"/> now 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>VVe thus judge,</hi> or we thus <hi>reaſon, That if one dyed for all, then were all dead.</hi> And further, this is an other concluſion, <hi>He dyed for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but to him which dyed for them, and roſe againe.</hi> There is no act of <hi>obedience,</hi> that a Saint under the Goſpell doth, but it proceeds from Goſpell, Spirituall <hi>reaſon,</hi> Chriſt dyed, God reveales this in the Scripture to me, and he ſeales this to my ſoule, that he dyed for me, when I was the veryeſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the world; why then there is all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World, he dying for me, that I ſhould live to him, and ſerve him all the dayes of my life; he redeemed me, and paid a rannſome for me, there is all the reaſon in the world, that I ſhould live to him, you muſt not thinke that the People of God take ſo much paines to deny themſelves, and to be carryed on in ſuch hard <hi>rough</hi> wayes, but that they are carryed on in a way of ſpirituall reaſoning.</p>
                     <p>And then for <hi>ſuffering;</hi> which is another part of a Chriſtians life. You ſhall read in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. <note place="margin">3 In ſuffering.</note> 
                        <hi>If we be children, then heires, heires of God, &amp; joynt heires with Chriſt, if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glrryfied together. For I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that ſhall be revealed in us. Reckon,</hi> or <hi>I reckon;</hi> for it is the ſame word in the Greek, that is, he did put the two ſums together, as one learned Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor ſayth, he put al the ſufferings on the one ſide as light things, as ſhort things, and the <hi>priviledges</hi> of the Saints on the other, that we are <hi>ſons, &amp; heires</hi>
                        <pb n="367" facs="tcp:53448:190"/> and <hi>coheirs</hi> with Chriſt, and that if we <hi>ſuffer</hi> with him, we ſhall be <hi>glorified</hi> with him, and ſo after all his <hi>reaſoning,</hi> he ſaw it was better to undergoe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings with Jeſus Chriſt, conſidering the <hi>gaine,</hi> and the <hi>loſs</hi> putting them both together in the Ballance, and therefore he reſolved to ſuffer any thing that God ſhould lay on him. So if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this place with 3 <hi>Cor. 4. 16. For this cauſe</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle) <hi>we faint not, but though our outward man periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day: for our light afflictions which are but for a moment, worke for us a far more exceeding and eternall weight of glory.</hi> We have abundance of <hi>afflictions</hi> as it is known to you Corinthians, as he ſaith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>VVe are afflicted on every ſide,</hi> there was a great deale of affliction, and yet notwithſtanding he did not <hi>faint,</hi> he was able to goe on, and ſuffer; Why ſo? Not phantaſtically, or <hi>raſhly,</hi> as many a carnall man may doe, for it is not ſo with a Saint, he will chooſe <hi>diſhonour</hi> when he may have <hi>honour,</hi> but it is upon good <hi>reaſon,</hi> I will tell you why; becauſe <hi>though the outward man periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith he, <hi>our light afflictions which are but for a moment, they worke to us an exceeding eternall weight of glory.</hi> As if he had ſaid, the afflictions which are now upon me, however you may conceive them to be <hi>great,</hi> yet in the Skales of ſpirituall reaſon, I ſee they are but <hi>light,</hi> and little in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what the wicked ſhall ſuffer, and of what I have deſerved: and it is but for a <hi>moment,</hi> it is but for a <hi>time,</hi> and it doth worke, an <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> exceſſive <hi>weight</hi> of glory, and therefore I
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:53448:191"/> have all the reaſon in the World to ſuffer afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for if the outward man ſuffer, the inward man gets by it; and if it be <hi>light,</hi> there is a <hi>weight</hi> of glory, and if it be for a <hi>moment,</hi> there is an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> weight of glory. And ſaith he, <hi>We doe not looke at things that are ſeene, for they are temporall, but at things that are not ſeene which are eternall.</hi> We looke at things in a ſpirituall way; and thus ſaith he, I bleſs God I doe not <hi>faint:</hi> and thus we have opened the Leſſon to you, that they that walke according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> are led by <hi>carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> and they that walk according to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> are ruled by <hi>ſpirituall reaſons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now before I come to proove the doctrine unto you, to make way for it, becauſe in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion it is a ſpirituall thing (as I ſhall ſhew you hereafter) There is nothing that I know in this bleſſed Booke, that may help you in a clearer way to diſcover your eſtates to you in a ſpirituall way, for ſuch as the <hi>man</hi> is, ſuch is his <hi>mind,</hi> and ſuch as his <hi>actions</hi> are, ſuch is his <hi>mind,</hi> and we may better underſtand the <hi>acts,</hi> then the <hi>mind,</hi> and we may better underſtand <hi>both,</hi> then the <hi>man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore that you may underſtand this, I will lay downe three things before hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Three things premiſed.</note> I come to proove the Doctrine, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie it.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is this, that there is in all <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> in <note place="margin">1. Godlines hath the beſt reaſon</note> every part of it, excellent <hi>reaſons,</hi> there is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, <hi>ſublimeſt,</hi> excellenteſt reaſon in godlineſſe. Beloved, I may ſay, and ſay truely of <hi>godlineſs</hi> in a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> ſence, what ever you may ſay of <hi>Logick</hi>
                        <pb n="369" facs="tcp:53448:191"/> in a naturall way. <hi>Logick</hi> is the art of <hi>reaſoning,</hi> that is the definition of it, it is the right <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>reaſoning,</hi> ſo <hi>godlineſſe</hi> is the right art of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reaſoning. There is not one dram of right <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reaſoning</hi> but in <hi>godly</hi> people: and there is not one <hi>act</hi> in godly people,, but it is carried on upon the pureſt, and ſublimeſt, and excellenteſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is; it is ſuch a kind of <hi>reaſon,</hi> that the Apoſtle calls it <hi>demonſtration,</hi> that is the ſureſt <hi>reaſoning</hi> in naturall Logick. Now in that you have other kind of reaſoning, as <hi>conjectures,</hi> and <hi>probabilities,</hi> and other <hi>topicks;</hi> but godly <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is <hi>demonstration,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith. And therefore in 2 <hi>Theſ. 3. 2. wicked</hi> men that have not <hi>faith,</hi> they are ſaid to be <hi>unreaſonable men,</hi> he is a <hi>wicked</hi> man that hath not <hi>faith,</hi> let him be never ſo <hi>honeſt,</hi> or <hi>civill,</hi> yet <hi>in</hi> Gods language, if he have not faith, he is a wicked man; <hi>Paul</hi> prays that he may be <hi>delivered from ureaſonable men,</hi> from <hi>abſurd</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Abſurd, what.</note> men as you have it the margine. Now what is it to be <hi>abſurd?</hi> you ſay when a man carries himſelf <hi>illfavouredly,</hi> that is abſurd; properly then when a man reaſons not rightly, it is abſurd, as to draw wrong concluſions from premiſes; as to ſay ſuch a Towne is <hi>garriſoned</hi> by the King, therefore <hi>London</hi> hath the <hi>plague,</hi> this is <hi>abſurd.</hi> Now all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and doings of wicked men, they are abſurd, there is no more hold of them, then of a rope of ſand. A wicked man may have <hi>naturall reaſon,</hi> and <hi>corrupt reaſon</hi> enough, but he is an <hi>unreaſonable</hi> man, he hath no <hi>ſpirituall reaſon.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ground of Saints con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And hence it is, that godly ſpirituall men are ſo conſtant in their Spirits, and in their wayes;
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53448:192"/> 
                        <hi>indeed</hi> they are not abſolutely conſtant becauſe they are godly but in part, but ſo far as a man, is godly, ſo far he is conſtant. As you may ſee in naturall things, the difference betweene a man that is at <hi>full</hi> age, and hath <hi>reaſon,</hi> and a Child that is not come up to reaſon, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>be not as little children, toſſed too and fro,</hi> Now what is the reaſon that a Child is ſo inconſtant; he will love a thing to day, and have it to bed with him; and to <hi>morrow</hi> he will caſt it in the dirt? it is becauſe his actions are carryed by <hi>fancie,</hi> and he hath not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to rule, and <hi>ſway</hi> him. Now you know a man doth not doe, and undoe things like a Child. See what difference there is in a <hi>naturall</hi> way, between a <hi>man</hi> at full age, and a <hi>Child</hi> at three or foure yeares old; ſo much, and more difference there is, betweene a <hi>godly,</hi> ſpirituall man, and a <hi>naturall</hi> man: and that is the reaſon, that when a <hi>godly</hi> man, heares a <hi>naturall</hi> man diſcourſe, and ſay he will do <hi>this,</hi> and that, he will go to the <hi>Wars,</hi> and he will take this, and that <hi>garriſon,</hi> he ſmiles at it, becauſe he knowes, he will not be conſtant. Take men all along in theſe wars for ſome yeares paſt, whither they were <hi>Commanders</hi> or others, you ſhall ſee how many brave reſolute men both went forth, and were here in the Parliament at home, and where are they now? But now take a <hi>godly</hi> man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Army,</hi> or elſewhere, and you cannot ſay of him, he was ſo; but he is ſo: becauſe he hath ſome reaſon to carry him along, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath not; he went for the glory of God, &amp; the reſpect of that continues with him, the other went out for a ſhew, for a blaſt, and ſo are turned about
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53448:192"/> with every winde like a Wether-cock, and all this for want of ſpirituall reaſon. <note place="margin">Why the Saints are comfortable in the worſt condition.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, it appeares by this, why the <hi>Saints</hi> that are godly, and <hi>ſpirituall</hi> are ſo <hi>comfortable,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the worſt condition; and why other men are ſo apt to be dejected. Take a Saint, and put him into any condition, and he knowes how to <hi>rejoyce</hi> in the Lord. Take a <hi>Paul,</hi> or a <hi>Sylas,</hi> and put them in Priſon, and let them be to be hanged to morrow, and yet they can rejoyce, and <hi>ſing,</hi> they can <hi>rejoce in tribulation,</hi> as well as in <hi>proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but now men that have not <hi>faith,</hi> that are not <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> though they <hi>laugh</hi> loud ſometimes when they are in <hi>Proſperitie,</hi> yet when <hi>affliction</hi> comes they are <hi>downe</hi> againe; and this comes from hence, not beeauſe godly men are <hi>mad</hi> men that they can <hi>rejoyce</hi> in <hi>Chaines</hi> as men in <hi>bedlome</hi> doe; but it is from <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reaſoning. When they are in <hi>affliction</hi> they can <hi>reaſon.</hi> I am now in much <hi>ſhame,</hi> and <hi>povertie,</hi> but I know that they that are in <hi>Christ,</hi> all ſhall turne to their <hi>good,</hi> they are <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and all is for their <hi>Salvation.</hi> And thus they will draw from the Scriptures by the help of the Spirit of God ſuch kind of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as will draw them up, and fill them with <hi>joy,</hi> even in the <hi>worst</hi> condition, which becauſe the others have not, they are <hi>up,</hi> and <hi>down,</hi> though their laughter be louder as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, yet it is but as the <hi>crackling of thornes,</hi> that end in ſmoake, and ſmother, and aſhes: O, the godly are endued with a great deale of <hi>ſpirituall reaſoning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And hence it was, becauſe there is ſo much <hi>reaſon</hi> in godlineſſe, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell</hi>
                        <pb n="372" facs="tcp:53448:193"/> of Jeſus Chriſt by a few Fiſher-men, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible</hi> men, without any force of <hi>rme,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Sword</hi> drawne, they have bene able to breake the great Emperour of the World, and to plant <hi>Religion</hi> over a great part of the World. It is true, there is no <hi>naturall</hi> reaſon in it in the World, that a hundred, or halfe a hundred ſhould goe forth, and tell a Storie of a man that was a <hi>Carpenters</hi> ſonne, a poore man that was at laſt <hi>hanged</hi> upon a <hi>Tree</hi> by the Jewes, and buryed in a Grave; and for a company of <hi>poore</hi> men that had no <hi>oratorie</hi> in the world, to goe and tell People, that by this man is ſalvation, and that they muſt believe in him, and that they had no power in themſelves to doe it; and that if they did believe in him, they muſt deny themſelves, and <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>Lands,</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> and then they ſhould have a <hi>Reward,</hi> they knew not where, nor whence, hereafter in <hi>Heaven,</hi> but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this World; which there was no <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> reaſon to perſwade them to, and there was no <hi>Sword</hi> to Command them; for their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was onely to tell men, that if they <hi>beleived, they ſhould be ſaved,</hi> and if they did <hi>not</hi> beleive, they muſt be <hi>damned,</hi> and yet we ſee the Goſpell hath prevailed in many Kingdomes of the World, more or leſſe. Now when <hi>Mahomet</hi> came, he comes as a great man, and when he was asked, how will you proove your Religion to be <hi>true?</hi> He takes a <hi>Sword</hi> and ſaith by this: Such is the Doctrine of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> but the Doctrine of the Goſpell came not ſo.</p>
                     <p>Now you muſt not conceive that the <hi>Goſpell</hi>
                        <pb n="373" facs="tcp:53448:193"/> works like a <hi>charme,</hi> that it works upon men like <hi>mad</hi> men, but hence it comes to paſs that though there be no <hi>naturall</hi> reaſon in it, nor the <hi>wiſedome</hi> of <hi>men</hi> yet they ſpeake in <hi>demonſtration</hi> of the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> they ſpeake the <hi>wiſedome</hi> of God to <hi>them that are perfect.</hi> There is <hi>ſpirituall reaſon</hi> in every <hi>peice</hi> of that Doctrine that is able to ſatisfie a man: and were there not <hi>ſtronger</hi> reaſon then any is in the World, men would never <hi>yeild</hi> to it. Thus I have given you a few hints, to ſhew you that there is abundance of profound <hi>reaſon</hi> in <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, when we ſee that <hi>godly</hi> men are ſo meek, <note place="margin">Gentleneſſe in gody men whence it is</note> ſo <hi>gentle,</hi> ſo <hi>eaſie to be intreated.</hi> Whence is this? From the ſtrength of <hi>ſpirituall reaſon</hi> that is in them. As it is <hi>in naturall</hi> things, you know <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are the weaker Veſſells,</hi> the Scripture ſaith ſo, and they are more apt to be <hi>froward</hi> then men. Why ſo? Becauſe there is not ſuch ſtrength of reaſon in them. Now <hi>men</hi> that are at full <hi>age,</hi> and have ſtrength of <hi>reaſon,</hi> they will beare <hi>unkindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, it is the glory of a man to paſs by an offence;</hi> it is the <hi>wiſedome</hi> of a man to paſs by an <hi>injurie.</hi> Now as it is in <hi>naturall</hi> things betweene a Man at full age, and a <hi>Child,</hi> ſuch a difference there is between godly, <hi>ſpirituall</hi> men, and <hi>naturall</hi> men; moſt <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi> men are <hi>froward,</hi> and <hi>peeviſh,</hi> and very <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentle,</hi> and <hi>hardly</hi> to be <hi>intreated:</hi> but the godly, as farr as they are godly, as farr as they have the <hi>wiſedome that is from above,</hi> they are made <hi>gentle,</hi> and <hi>eaſie</hi> to be <hi>intreated;</hi> becauſe they have ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall reaſon. As for inſtance, ſuppoſe a man offer another a great deale of <hi>unkindneſſe,</hi> and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53448:194"/> 
                        <hi>ſpeake</hi> very <hi>ill</hi> of him; <hi>naturall</hi> reaſon will ſay, why ſhould he <hi>doe</hi> this? or why ſhould I <hi>beare</hi> it? But ſpirituall reaſon comes in, and ſaith, <hi>When they curſe, doe you bleſs,</hi> and the Scripture teacheth me, that <hi>Chriſt loved me</hi> when I was an <hi>enemy,</hi> and ſo ſhould I doe to others. There is nothing that may <hi>provoke</hi> a godly man, but if he hath the uſe of <hi>ſpirituall reaſon,</hi> he may keepe his heart <hi>meeke,</hi> and <hi>calme</hi> as may be. Now you muſt not thinke that the Saints are <hi>ſtocks,</hi> or <hi>ſtones,</hi> for a Saint hath as much <hi>apprehenſion</hi> as a naturall man hath; but he hath <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reaſon, that he can ſhape the wrong done him, in a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Mold, and ſo carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>meekly,</hi> and <hi>quietly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, there is reaſon in godlineſſe, and <note place="margin">Godly men ſee their way in confuſed times.</note> hence it is that the <hi>godly</hi> in times of <hi>confuſion</hi> they can <hi>ſee</hi> their <hi>way</hi> in the middeſt of the miſt, <hi>when</hi> all others are at a <hi>loſs,</hi> and know not which way to go: a godly man can by <hi>ſpirituall reaſon</hi> ſeek out his <hi>way,</hi> as there is a full inſtance in theſe times, all <hi>carnall</hi> men are at a <hi>loſs,</hi> and think that all <hi>Religion</hi> is gone into <hi>confuſion,</hi> and one <hi>Governour</hi> is gone, and another come, and <hi>one</hi> man is of this opinion, and another of <hi>another;</hi> the whole World, even thoſe that are meere <hi>Spectators,</hi> they know not which way to <hi>goe,</hi> yet now the <hi>Saints</hi> that are <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> they can <hi>ſerve</hi> God, as <hi>fully,</hi> &amp; as <hi>ſweetly</hi> as ever.

                     <p>And hence it is, by this <hi>ſpirituall reaſoning,</hi> that the veiw and <hi>contemplation</hi> of their lives <hi>paſt</hi> is ſo <hi>ſweet</hi> to them, and affords them ſo much <hi>comfort,</hi> as farr as it was <hi>Religious,</hi> whereas they remember their <hi>ſinfull</hi> actions with <hi>ſhame,</hi> and <hi>naturall</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53448:194"/> with <hi>ſorrow.</hi> When we come to be <hi>men,</hi> we cannot indure to think of our <hi>carriage</hi> when we were Children, as making little <hi>houſes</hi> of <hi>ſtrawes,</hi> and of <hi>clay, &amp;c.</hi> When a man comes to be a <hi>man</hi> he rejoyceth more that he hath gotten ſuch a <hi>houſe,</hi> and purchaſed ſuch <hi>land,</hi> and he rejoyceth in his <hi>Wife,</hi> and <hi>Children.</hi> There is more <hi>pleaſure</hi> in the remembrance of a <hi>rationall</hi> act, then of a <hi>fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> though when we were Children there was more pleaſure in a <hi>fantasticall</hi> act then in a <hi>ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> as a Child hath more pleaſure, and will, to make Pies of clay, then a man hath to purchaſe a Houſe and Land.

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:53448:195"/> caught with <hi>chaffe,</hi> they are not caught with <hi>luſts,</hi> as <hi>naturall</hi> men are: you know little <hi>Children,</hi> how you may catch them with a <hi>Babie,</hi> or a <hi>top,</hi> and a <hi>ſcourge,</hi> all the yeare about, you may feed their fancie by bringing them ſome new <hi>toy</hi> home, but a man of forty yeares old you cannot pleaſe him with a <hi>babie,</hi> or with a Horſe of wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such is the difference betweene a <hi>naturall</hi> man, and a Spirituall man, you may pleaſe a <hi>naturall</hi> man, and catch him with a good <hi>Office,</hi> or ſome ſuch thing, but take a <hi>through,</hi> full growne, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall man (as we have bleſſed be God ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in the <hi>Armie,</hi> and in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Cittie)</hi> you offer him <hi>chaffe</hi> when you offer him theſe things, when you would tempt him to leave <hi>God,</hi> and to imbrace the <hi>World.</hi> That <hi>Germane beaſt,</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> will not be caught with <hi>Gold,</hi> ſuch a man will not be catched with a <hi>bribe:</hi> a Saint can <hi>outreaſon</hi> all ſuch <hi>luſts,</hi> he ſees they are but the <hi>pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to you that in godlineſſe there is agreat deale of <hi>reaſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay let me add this before I goe further, there <note place="margin">The beſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> is the <hi>profoundeſt,</hi> and moſt excellent <hi>reaſon,</hi> and <hi>reaſoning that can be</hi> in <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> and I will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it to you in three things. That there is <hi>reaſon</hi> you have heard: Now I ſhall ſhew you that there is the profoundeſt, and the beſt reaſon, and that there is no <hi>reaſon</hi> to be compared to it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe that in godlineſſe there is a <hi>light</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. There is a new light in the ſoule.</note> put into the <hi>ſoule,</hi> whence a man may reaſon: for man cannot reaſon without <hi>light</hi> put into the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53448:195"/> mind. That is the reaſon why a <hi>Horſe</hi> cannot <hi>reaſon,</hi> becauſe there is not <hi>light</hi> in him, <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> to <hi>deduct</hi> one thing from another. Now the light we have in <hi>naturall</hi> things is very <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> and dim and <hi>darke,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, you ſee in naturall things how imperfect Arts are, as <hi>Phyſick,</hi> &amp;c. Why? becauſe the principles are <hi>few,</hi> we gather ſome things from herbes, &amp;c. the <hi>principles</hi> are not <hi>cleare,</hi> but ſuch men have try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch, and ſuch concluſions, and ſo they make up an argument, but this is but dimme.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there are in <hi>nature</hi> but <hi>darke,</hi> and <hi>confuſed</hi> principles: for <hi>reaſon</hi> is a deducting of <note place="margin">2 Naturall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples darke.</note> one thing from another; <hi>reaſon</hi> is a dividing, as if you ſhould ſee the river <hi>Nilus,</hi> they draw the river from the <hi>maine</hi> Channell to a leſſer, and from that to another: So <hi>reaſon</hi> is nothing but the <hi>drawing</hi> forth of the light that is in a man, to this or that uſe, according as there ſhall be occaſion. Now in <hi>nature,</hi> we have but <hi>darke principles,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot draw things certainly: but in <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> there are ſuch <hi>principles,</hi> that every thing in the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> is called cleare <hi>demonſtration.</hi> Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, when a man ſets forth a thing, when he proves a thing <hi>eſſentially,</hi> and <hi>infallibly:</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations are infallible, if they be truly and clearly drawne: So then the meaning of it is, that all the <hi>principles</hi> of the Goſpell they are cleare, and plain; they are demonſtrations, infallible to a ſpirituall mind: a <hi>carnall</hi> man may doubt of them, but <hi>wee ſpeak wiſedome to them that are perfect.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, the <hi>facultie</hi> of the ſoule whereby we do apprehend this light, and in which
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:53448:196"/> we retain theſe <hi>principles,</hi> it is a great deal more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. I ſay the <hi>facultie,</hi> that is the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> minde: for I told you before, there were three minds, This <hi>ſpirituall minde</hi> is nothing elſe but the new <note place="margin">Spirituall mind what.</note> Creature; there is in a Chriſtian the old Creature and the new Creature; and the Scripture ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily calls it the <hi>old man,</hi> and the <hi>new man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is the <hi>new man?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing in the world, but God puts as it were a <hi>new underſtanding</hi> in him; that is, he puts a <hi>new light</hi> in his underſtanding, and frames his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to be capable of that new light. For the minde we have naturally cannot receive ſpirituall things. Therefore it is not only a new quality, there is ſomthing more, or elſe God would not call it the <hi>new man,</hi> but the new quality, which he doth no where in Scripture; the Lord frames in the ſoule a capabillity, a faculty to apprehend and reaſon upon Spirituall things; and this is called the <hi>new man,</hi> and this comes from Jeſus Chriſt, and his holy Spirit, and is upon the growing hand more and more.</p>
                     <p>Now the other facultie, the <hi>naturall</hi> facultie, is corrupt with <hi>luſts. The old man is corrupt.</hi> And when I ſay the old man, you muſt take the <hi>naturall</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Old man what.</note> man, as well as the ſinfull man. The old man is corrupt; what is that? he is corrupt, that is, he is <hi>rotten,</hi> How comes he to be <hi>rotten?</hi> He is <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>luſts</hi> of it: As it is with <hi>Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> it would continue a long time, if it have not rayne come upon it, but if rayne fall on it, it makes it decay: ſo the naturall mind, the <hi>naturall</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Sin corrupts the naturall faculties.</note> facultie in <hi>Adam</hi> before he ſinned was great
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:53448:196"/> deale more cleare, and therefore <hi>Adam</hi> was a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>naturaliſt</hi> then any man, then all the men in the world; <hi>Adam</hi> was a better <hi>Navigator,</hi> a better <hi>Phiſitian,</hi> a better any thing. But as ſinne raiſed the Law of God out of mans heart, ſo ſinne begun to <hi>rot,</hi> and <hi>corrupt</hi> the naturall <hi>excellencies</hi> of man, as his mind, &amp;c. and that right reaſon that <hi>Adam</hi> had before his fall, you ſee how he did name all the creatures, and what wiſedome he had, but after his fall, ſinne had not been long in him, but he was more corrupt. As you ſee in a houſe where there is a hole in the thatch, if the raine come in but two or three dayes, the <hi>Timber</hi> will not be much rotted, but in time it will ſpoyle it, So wee ſee after, when ſinne came to increaſe more in the dayes of <hi>Cain,</hi> man was more tainted; and yet ſurely, then naturall knowledge was more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then now it is, for you ſee what <hi>inventions</hi> they had <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. of <hi>muſick,</hi> and <hi>building,</hi> and <hi>Tents,</hi> and many things that they invented in Arts.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, it is an eaſie thing to make <hi>Tents,</hi> and <hi>Organs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is an eaſie thing to perfect a thing that hath been 5000. yeares finding out, but were you now to find out the thing, it were not eaſie. Now I ſay that ſinne doth <hi>rott,</hi> and <hi>ruſt</hi> the <hi>nature</hi> of man more, and more; and as ſinne gets head more; ſo more, and more it will rot the faculties of man: but the facultie we have in the <hi>new man,</hi> it is new, it was never <hi>tainted;</hi> never any <hi>drop</hi> came into it, to <hi>corrupt</hi> it: for when God creates the <hi>new Creature,</hi> he makes it a more excellent peice then he did the old; and this growes more and more: &amp; therefore ſeeing there is clearer light, &amp; <hi>excellenter principles</hi> &amp;
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:53448:197"/> a <hi>profounder</hi> facultie, there muſt needs be a more bleſſed, and glorious way of <hi>reaſoning</hi> in a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> way then in a naturall way. I had thought to have gone over the other two things premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but the time is paſt, and therefore I will only now conclude this with one or two ſhort words of uſe.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of all, I will here in love admoniſh <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Not to reject all reaſon in godlineſſe.</note> you that are the people of God, to take heed of that deviſe of Satan whereby he would perſwade the Saints that there is no <hi>reaſon</hi> in godlineſſe. <hi>Reaſon</hi> is a word that is much prejudiced among Profeſſors: and if a man ſpeake of <hi>reaſon,</hi> they are ready to ſlight it, and ſay, ſhew me <hi>Scripture;</hi> as if ſound ſpirituall <hi>reaſon,</hi> and the Scripture, were contrary one to another; they are readie to ſay, what doe you talk to me of <hi>reaſon,</hi> ſhew me a <hi>Text</hi> for it: It is true, we muſt not talk of <hi>carnall, corrupt</hi> reaſon, that is abhominable, nor of <hi>naturall</hi> reaſon, that is too ſhort; but we may, and muſt in any thing belonging to godlineſſe, take in <hi>ſpirituall reaſon,</hi> and if it hold not with <hi>ſpirituall reaſon,</hi> doe not admit of it, let it be what Opinion it will.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of your wandrings and miſtakes doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from want of obſerving ſpirituall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: we <hi>reject</hi> reaſon, and goe and take a <hi>place</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and ſo hand over head goe along, and not <hi>deduct</hi> things, as <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> did. But beware of this, for there is nothing in <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> but thon mayeſt find ſound <hi>reaſon</hi> in it; there is no <hi>abſurdity</hi> in godlineſſe; <hi>abſurdity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to wicked men that have <hi>not faith.</hi> Take
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53448:197"/> heed of <hi>rejecting</hi> all kind of <hi>reaſon</hi> in godlineſſe; reject <hi>carnall</hi> reaſon, and expect <hi>godlineſſe</hi> to be above <hi>naturall</hi> reaſon, but if there be not <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reaſon in what thou doeſt, it is not of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is a word of <hi>exhortation,</hi> or <hi>invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Invitation to come to Chriſt.</note> to you that are <hi>carnall,</hi> that you would <hi>come</hi> in, and receive <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> that you would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>godlineſſe</hi> by him.</p>
                     <p>Why ſo?</p>
                     <p>Becauſe there is nothing in <hi>nature</hi> that may <hi>take</hi> with man, but there is that, and that in a more excellent way in <hi>grace,</hi> if men had grace to heed it. You know what takes with men in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ordinarily, moſt of mankind, are <hi>weake,</hi> and come not up ſo high as to <hi>action,</hi> and <hi>contempld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> but you know what takes with them, <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> &amp;c. Now the Scripture tells us, in Chriſt we ſhall in herite all theſe things: ſome affect <hi>Liberty,</hi> here is that alſo, <hi>If the Son make you free, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> And whatſoever men can fancie, ſaith Chriſt, Come, and <hi>buy of me gold, and Rayment, and milk, and honey, and Kingdomes, and Crownes,</hi> and whatſoever the nature of man is capable of. But there are ſome that feed not upon <hi>ſenſuall</hi> things, and to tell them of <hi>pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> by Chriſt, doth not ſo much take them: but thou art it may be an <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall</hi> man that <hi>studieſt</hi> the contemplation of things that belong to the <hi>underſtanding</hi> if thou <note place="margin">Godlineſſe hath that that will exerciſe the intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals.</note> wilt come to Chriſt thou ſhalt find ſuch matter for thy <hi>underſtanding</hi> to work on, <hi>rationall</hi> things that thou waſt never acquainted with before. There are ſome men if you ſhould give them all
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53448:198"/> the contentments in the World, yet if they had not <hi>rationall companie,</hi> and <hi>Books</hi> ſuitable to their <hi>underſtanding,</hi> you could never <hi>content</hi> them: for indeed that is a greater <hi>delight</hi> by farr which is ſuitable to the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> then that which fits the <hi>fancie;</hi> and therefore when that is <hi>faſtned</hi> on, the other will be <hi>gone.</hi> As a child, when he is a child, he loves <hi>tops,</hi> and <hi>trifles,</hi> and the like, but when he comes to be a <hi>man</hi> he <hi>ſlights</hi> them. So a man that loves <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Profit, &amp;c.</hi> in a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi> way, if he come to <hi>ſtudie</hi> the <hi>Arts,</hi> he will <hi>ſlight riches.</hi> So if ever you will draw the man to godlineſſe, you muſt give him ſomthing that will delight him, <hi>delight</hi> his <hi>intellectualls.</hi> Now I ſay, there is that in <hi>godlineſse,</hi> which all that is in <hi>humane</hi> Books, is not to be compared to it, it is but ſolly in compariſon. I will inſtance in one place, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 10. 11. 12. VVhere <hi>wiſdome doth crie cut in the Streets.</hi> The meaning is, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is called <hi>VViſedome,</hi> is inviting poore ſinners to come to him, <hi>Receive my inſtruction,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and not ſilver, and knowledge rather then choyce gold. Solomon,</hi> or any wiſe man would prefer <hi>Inſtruction</hi> before <hi>gold,</hi> and <hi>ſilver. For wiſdome is better then Rubies, and all the things that may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired are not to be compared to it.</hi> Theſe are ſenſuall things, what is there more in a <hi>rubie,</hi> then a <hi>pebble</hi> but only the <hi>fancie.</hi> Now <hi>Wiſdome is better then ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies.</hi> And wouldeſt thou know where to have this wiſdome? <hi>I wiſdome dwell with prudence, or with ſuttlety,</hi> as ſome reade it, <hi>and find out know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of wittie inventions:</hi> there are not in all the World ſuch <hi>wittie inventions,</hi> as there are in <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="383" facs="tcp:53448:198"/>
                     <p>A Chriſtian finds out more <hi>witty inventions</hi> in a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> way in a <hi>day,</hi> then a hundred <hi>naturall</hi> men do in all their life time. And <hi>inventions</hi> in a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> way, are farre more taking with a man, than thoſe in a <hi>naturall</hi> way, <hi>come to me, and I will give thee knowledge of witty inventions,</hi> ſuch matter for thy <hi>invention</hi> to worke on, as thou never hadſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I will diſcover ſuch as ſhall ſatisfie thee. I have knowne one once, that was ready to be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted,</hi> becauſe he could ſee nothing in the world that could ſatisfie his <hi>underſtanding,</hi> he ſaw all the world was but a <hi>whirlpoole</hi> of <hi>vanity,</hi> and <hi>vexation,</hi> and juſt as he was going to turne <hi>mad,</hi> God let the manifeſtation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> into his ſoule, and that ſatisfied his <hi>underſtanding,</hi> there was a fit <note place="margin">Chriſt only can ſatisfie the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</note> 
                        <hi>ſubject,</hi> there was all the <hi>choyce</hi> reaſonings in the world to work on: there was enough to ſatisfie his <hi>will,</hi> and to keep him in his <hi>wits,</hi> and to make him <hi>comfortable,</hi> and <hi>joyfull,</hi> or elſe he was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he ſhould have been diſtracted.</p>
                     <p>For in naturall things there is a little comfort, but alwayes a man looks upon the <hi>back</hi> of it, he looks <hi>behind</hi> it, and ſaith, what ſhall I doe when this is gone?</p>
                     <p>Now when <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> comes in, he ſatisfies the ſoule; a man looks not behind <hi>Chriſts</hi> back to ſay what ſhall I doe, when Chriſt is gone? but he and he only, is enough to ſatisfie a man: therefore art thou a man given to <hi>contemplation,</hi> and ſtudy Arts, be adviſed by Jeſus Chriſt, this is the way to <hi>finde</hi> out <hi>rare inventions,</hi> to come to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp; ſtudy the deep things of the Goſpell, and there thou
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53448:199"/> ſhalt finde out <hi>wittie inventions,</hi> and deviſes world without end.</p>
                     <p>One word more, and I have done; laſtly, hence it doth follow clearely, that <hi>godly</hi> men that are <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Godly men the wiſeſt men</note> truly godly, and <hi>ſpirituall.</hi> I doe not ſay every <hi>paltry</hi> hollow-hearted <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> but a <hi>godly ſpirituall</hi> man, is the wiſeſt man. Why ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath the moſt <hi>excellent,</hi> and profound <hi>reaſon,</hi> he hath a maſſe of rationallity, that the world knowes not of: we may ſay of a godly man, as the Heathen ſaid of a <hi>learned</hi> man, a learned man hath foure eyes, and the <hi>vulgar</hi> have but two, ſo a <hi>godly</hi> man hath three eyes, and a <hi>naturall</hi> man hath but two, and ſcarce that; a naturall man can <hi>reaſon</hi> things, but it is with a <hi>corrupt,</hi> or a <hi>naturall eye;</hi> but a Saint can reaſon with a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> eye. <hi>Naturall</hi> men have but a little <hi>darke</hi> light in <hi>naturall</hi> things, but a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> man can <hi>reaſon</hi> in <hi>naturall</hi> things, and in <hi>ſpirituall</hi> too, <hi>Wiſedome is juſtified of her children.</hi> If a Plow-man ſhould come to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and heare their diſputes in <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> or <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> he underſtands not the termes, and would thinke that they were mad, <hi>yet wiſedome is juſtified of her children;</hi> they that know what thoſe <hi>Arts</hi> are, they will ſay they diſputed very well. So the world condemns <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> and thinks that godly men are <hi>mad</hi> men: but <hi>Wiſedome is justified of her children.</hi> You call it <hi>fooliſhneſſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>Wee ſpeake wiſedome to thoſe that be perfect.</hi> And therefore you ſhall have the godly uſually when they are deſcribed in Scripture, they are called <hi>wiſe men,</hi> as it is often <note place="margin">Wiſe men in Scripture who.</note> in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> the wiſe man and the <hi>Foole</hi> are put

He can judge of things <hi>naturally,</hi> and <hi>corruptly,</hi> becauſe he hath been ſo himſelf, and he knowes how to iudge <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> which the other cannot doe.

                     <p>I premiſed three things, before I could come to proove the Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>The firſt was this, that there is <hi>excellent reaſon</hi> in all <hi>godlineſſe;</hi> there is <hi>reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>beſt reaſon,</hi> as I ſhewed you at large, and made two or three uſes of it.</p>
                     <p>Now to goe forward a little, the ſecond thing, breifly that I muſt premiſe, before I proove this leſſon, it is this: that,
<q>
                           <p>The reaſonings of the Soule, are the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, <note place="margin">Second thing premiſed.</note> and excellenteſt acts of the mind.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>understanding</hi> is the higheſt <hi>facultie</hi> of the <hi>ſoule;</hi> ſo the <hi>reaſonings</hi> of the <hi>mind</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the mind are the higheſt acts of it.</note> are the moſt <hi>excellent,</hi> and moſt <hi>immediate</hi> acts of the <hi>mind.</hi> The <hi>mind</hi> is <hi>Chriſts,</hi> or the <hi>Devills</hi> cheif <hi>Throne.</hi> If <hi>Chriſt</hi> be in the ſoule, he keeps his <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> in the <hi>mind:</hi> if the <hi>Devill</hi> be in the ſoule, he keeps his <hi>Garriſon</hi> in the <hi>mind.</hi> So the reaſonings of the <hi>mind</hi> are the cheife <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the mind, the immediate flowings of the mind. The whole acts of the ſoule are like the <hi>New River:</hi> it comes to <hi>LONDON,</hi> and then you have <hi>Conduits</hi> to receive it, and thoſe ſend it to <hi>Wooden</hi> Pipes, and thoſe ſend it to <hi>Leaden</hi> Pipes, and ſo to your <hi>Kitchins,</hi> and <hi>Sellars:</hi> ſo the ſoule, the <hi>mind</hi> is as the <hi>New River,</hi> the <hi>reaſoning</hi> of the ſoule, that is the <hi>Conduit</hi> that receives it firſt; from the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning</hi> it comes to the <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> and then it goes out into the <hi>actions:</hi> ſo the <hi>reaſonings</hi> of the <hi>mind</hi> are the firſt, and cheifeſt, and <hi>ſupreame</hi> part of all the <hi>actions</hi> thereof. Therefore if the <hi>mind</hi> be <hi>naught,</hi> the whole <hi>ſoule</hi> is <hi>naught,</hi> if the <hi>reaſonings</hi> be <hi>naught,</hi> the whole <hi>ſoule,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> is
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:53448:201"/> 
                        <hi>naught</hi> alſo. But, becauſe I would paſſe from that, the uſe of it in a word is this, that</p>
                     <p>Hence we ſee the <hi>reaſon,</hi> why the <hi>wiſeſt men,</hi> the moſt <hi>rationall</hi> men, are uſually the <hi>worſt</hi> men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe.</hi> The moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall men without grace the worſt.</note> they have more ſtrength of <hi>reaſon</hi> then other men; the <hi>reaſon</hi> being <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>naught,</hi> the <hi>ſtronger</hi> that reaſon is the <hi>worſe</hi> the man is. Therfore if I have a <hi>child</hi> or a <hi>friend</hi> that is a <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> man, if he be not made a <hi>good</hi> man, I wiſh he may never be very <hi>rationall,</hi> or <hi>reaſonable,</hi> becauſe the <hi>ſtronger</hi> his <hi>reaſon</hi> is, being <hi>corrupt,</hi> the man <hi>ill</hi> he is in his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>affections.</hi> When men are mad with <hi>reaſon:</hi> many of the <hi>vulgar</hi> are <hi>mad without</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Men mad with reaſon.</note> 
                        <hi>reaſon,</hi> they will hate a thing upon here ſay, O ſuch a one is an <hi>Independant,</hi> and this, and that, but when men are <hi>mad</hi> with <hi>reaſon,</hi> when they have <hi>wicked reaſon,</hi> they are mad to purpoſe, they are <hi>mad</hi> with a <hi>vengeance</hi> as we ſay.</p>
                     <p>And that is the reaſon that the Apoſtle ſaith that the Lord hath not <hi>choſen</hi> many <hi>wiſe,</hi> nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Noble,</hi> but <hi>ſimple people,</hi> and <hi>ſimple</hi> things, God doth not ordinarily doe it. As now in the Army fighting abroad, uſually they doe not take <hi>great,</hi> ſtrong <hi>Garriſons,</hi> but little <hi>pettie</hi> ones are taken to and againe, daily. So, <hi>not many wiſe men are called,</hi> God takes ſome great <hi>ſtrong Garriſons:</hi> for it is a ſtrong <hi>Garriſon</hi> of the <hi>Devill,</hi> when a great <note place="margin">Davils ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt garriſons.</note> 
                        <hi>learned</hi> man is without the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God; it is like <hi>Ports mouth, &amp;c.</hi> fortified ſtrongly, God may take away the <hi>weapons</hi> of the <hi>Devill,</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <hi>Ordnance</hi> he hath, is <hi>carnall reaſoning,</hi> but God doth it not ordinarily.</p>
                     <p>It was a ſaying of a godly man, and a rationall
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:53448:202"/> one too, he ſhooke his head and ſaid, I wiſh many times in the yeare, that I were deprived of this <hi>reaſon</hi> that is in me, that I might be wholly <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon,</hi> that there might be <hi>liberty</hi> for <hi>faith</hi> to work. He meant that <hi>naturall</hi> reaſon comes in, and <hi>hinders faith,</hi> and croſſeth ſpirituall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſon</hi> is ſo <hi>troubleſome,</hi> if it be carnall, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and unſanctified, that the more any man hath of it, the more <hi>enemy</hi> he is to God. Therefore, O that God would unbewitch, and undeceive you, and all the people of <hi>England,</hi> that you would not make <hi>men</hi> your <hi>guides,</hi> as they are indued with <hi>Learning,</hi> or <hi>reaſon,</hi> but the ſpirit of God. Goe to any <hi>Pariſh,</hi> or <hi>Towne,</hi> or place, and talk with any man about <hi>Heavenly</hi> things, and ask him why he doth <hi>thinke thus?</hi> He will ſay, we have a <hi>Learned Doctor</hi> in the Pariſh, and he ſaith ſo, and he doth ſo. The Lord hath ſaid that our <hi>Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſſe, and our Moone into blood.</hi> That is, all theſe <hi>glorious</hi> naturall things ſhall be daſhed in the <hi>laſt</hi> times, and God will <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt</hi> his <hi>ſpirit;</hi> ſince God hath promiſed it, let us expect it, obſerve what man in the pariſh hath moſt of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God, and of <hi>ſpirituall reaſon,</hi> and <hi>heare</hi> him, and be <hi>adviſed</hi> by him; and ſay of your great Doctors, and learned men, if <hi>God</hi> be not <hi>in them</hi> by his ſpirit, the <hi>more Learning,</hi> and the more <hi>reaſon</hi> they have, the more <hi>enemies</hi> they are to <hi>God,</hi> and therefore I will have nothing to <note place="margin">3. The reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the mind the cheife diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racter.</note> doe with them. There you have two things.</p>
                     <p>The third thing I ſhall <hi>premiſe,</hi> is, that the <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of</hi> the <hi>mind</hi> are the cheife <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:53448:202"/> of a man, by which principally above all things <hi>one</hi> is <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> from <hi>another, good</hi> men from <hi>bad:</hi> for the Apoſtle doth not reaſon here, from a <hi>known</hi> thing, to a <hi>darker;</hi> for he reaſons from the mind, and the acts of it, as if he had ſaid, that is the cheifeſt <hi>maine</hi> way, whereby to know the <hi>whole man</hi> whither he be <hi>fleſhly,</hi> or <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In naturall things, the more <hi>eſſentiall</hi> the <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> is, the more <hi>certaine,</hi> and ſure it is, and <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality</hi> is <hi>eſſentiall</hi> to a <hi>man,</hi> you may <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> a <hi>man</hi> from a <hi>beaſt</hi> otherwiſe; a <hi>man</hi> hath but <hi>two Legs,</hi> and ſo may be diſtinguiſhed from a <hi>Horſe,</hi> that hath <hi>foure;</hi> but this is not ſo certaine a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; but when you ſay <hi>man</hi> is <hi>rationall,</hi> that <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth</hi> him from all <hi>birds</hi> and <hi>beaſts.</hi> So there are many things in <hi>godlineſſe</hi> that you may partly know a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> by, by his <hi>works,</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> and by his <hi>company,</hi> and <hi>carriage,</hi> you may know him a little from <hi>another</hi> man, but theſe things are <hi>outward,</hi> and <hi>externall;</hi> but his <hi>reaſon</hi> is <hi>eſsentiall</hi> to him, you may know him above all theſe by his <hi>reaſoning</hi> in his <hi>ſoule,</hi> that is the moſt <hi>eſſentiall</hi> thing to a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as <hi>reaſon</hi> in it <hi>ſelfe</hi> conſidered, is moſt <hi>eſſentiall</hi> to a man.</p>
                     <p>Conſider this, for this is a thing by which you may underſtand clearly, <hi>what</hi> you are made of and what <hi>you</hi> are. There is nothing in <hi>godlineſse</hi> but an <hi>hypocrite,</hi> and a <hi>wicked</hi> man may come up to it, unleſſe it be this, to be carried on by <hi>ſpirituall reaſon.</hi> As for inſtance, a <hi>wicked</hi> man may <hi>know</hi> God, he may have a great deal of <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,</hi> and (to our eyes) of the ſpirituall eſtate
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53448:203"/> of <hi>godlineſse. Heb.</hi> 6. He may be <hi>enlightned,</hi> he may <hi>diſcourſe</hi> well, and <hi>Preach</hi> excellently, and <note place="margin">Carnall men may goe far in Religion.</note> 
                        <hi>Pray</hi> ſpiritually, he may have much <hi>knowledge,</hi> and all the Saints in the Countrey may account him conſtantly a <hi>cheife</hi> Profeſſor, and a moſt <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> Chriſtian. Nay he may <hi>love</hi> all good things in a ſort, or for the <hi>moſt</hi> part; a <hi>naturall</hi> man that is but <hi>commonly</hi> wrought on by the ſpirit of God, he may <hi>love prayer,</hi> and <hi>hearing,</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> and giving to the poore, and other good works, he may <hi>love,</hi> and delight in it, as <hi>Herod</hi> did to heare <hi>John</hi> ſpeake, he may love it for ſome carnall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances about it, and though he love it, yet all runs upon the Wheele of carnall reaſon. As for inſtance, I love very much to <hi>give</hi> to the <hi>poore,</hi> becauſe the <hi>pride</hi> of my heart will be much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in it. I would be held an <hi>emynent</hi> Profeſſor, and I <hi>invite Saints</hi> to my Houſe, and I quarell with them if they come not, but it is to hold out my <hi>vaineglory,</hi> not out of <hi>ſpirituall Love</hi> in my ſoule. So there is no peice of <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> but it may be cloathed with ſuch <hi>circumſtances,</hi> that a <hi>naturall</hi> man may <hi>love</hi> it, an <hi>hypocrite</hi> may doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing in <hi>godlineſse,</hi> and be an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> when he hath done.</p>
                     <p>But here is the difference, a <hi>Saint loves</hi> good, <note place="margin">Ground of Saints loving good things.</note> and that flowes from <hi>ſpirituall reaſon,</hi> and he doth good from <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reaſon. As for inſtance; I doe not give to the poore to keepe <hi>correſpondence,</hi> and to be <hi>well</hi> thought of, and becauſe I would be accounted <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> no; but I doe it from ſpirituall <hi>reaſoning,</hi> Chriſt loved <hi>me,</hi> and therefore I will love my <hi>Brother.</hi> So whatſoever a Saint
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:53448:203"/> doth, <hi>ſpirituall reaſon</hi> drawes him; and this is the moſt <hi>eſſentiall Character</hi> that diſtinguiſheth an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> from a true <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> It is not <hi>loving</hi> or <hi>knowing,</hi> or <hi>doing</hi> of good, but it is the Wheele that it goes on, whether it be <hi>ſpirituall</hi> or <hi>carnall</hi> reaſoning.</p>
                     <p>But may not a good man do ſome actions, from <hi>naturall</hi> or <hi>corrupt</hi> reaſoning? how is that then a <label type="milestone">

                     <p>A <hi>good</hi> man may doe an action from <hi>carnall</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning; <label type="milestone">

                        </label> 
                        <note place="margin">How a good man may be moved with naturall or carnal reaſon.</note> but a <hi>carnall</hi> man can never doe <hi>good</hi> from <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reaſoning: as that ſpeech of <hi>Peter</hi> in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing of Chriſt not to goe to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it was partly naturall, and partly corrupt reaſoning. But that you may ſee this clearely notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, you may diſcerne him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place a Chriſtian is moved by <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> reaſon, and in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place he may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by naturall reaſon: as ſuppoſe there be a good <hi>Miniſter</hi> that is full of <hi>grace,</hi> that deſires to doe good, and yet he and his Family is ready to ſtarve. The <hi>firſt</hi> thing that he bleſſeth God for, is, that he hath opportunity to <hi>teach Chriſt</hi> to the ſoules of poore <hi>people;</hi> that is the firſt, but next he ſaith, and bleſſed be God that there is a way to <hi>ſupport my Family;</hi> naturall reaſon is tyed to ſpirituall, as the little boat is to the ſhip.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, though a Saint may be carryed to an <note place="margin">2 A Saints ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall courſe by Spirituall reaſon</note> 
                        <hi>action</hi> with <hi>corrupt</hi> reaſon (that he pays deare for) yet the whole <hi>courſe</hi> of the life, and actions of a Chriſtian flow from <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reaſoning. O! that the Lord would give you to examine your ſelves,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:53448:204"/> by this, It is not by what thou <hi>accounteſt</hi> of, or what thou <hi>eſteemeſt</hi> or <hi>loveſt,</hi> but what mooves thee? what is the <hi>Wheele</hi> that ſets thee on worke? Is it a <hi>ſpirituall mind,</hi> that gives <hi>ſpirituall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> that moves thee all the day to good towards <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>man?</hi> I deſire that you would carry this with you, this is the <hi>eſſentiall</hi> difference betweene an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Aske when thou doſt an action, not how <hi>much</hi> thou doeſt, or what men conceive of it? though it be but a ſmall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ſuppoſe thou art a <hi>Maid</hi> that art <hi>ſweeping</hi> the houſe, or any ſuch meane thing, aske, why doe I this? what moves me? what is the maine ſpring? Is it that my <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Miſtris</hi> may not chide me? This is <hi>natural</hi> reaſoning, but thou ſhouldeſt ſay, I do it that I may <hi>obey Chriſt,</hi> he hath called me, and hath <hi>reedeemed</hi> me to live to him: and ſo it may be, a man may do thee an <hi>ill turn,</hi> and thou wouldeſt not doe him a <hi>miſchiefe</hi> againe, it is a good reſolution: but why doeſt thou not doe it? it is not becauſe thou art <hi>aſhamed,</hi> or <hi>afraid</hi> to doe it? But if there be a little ſpring within to thinke, <hi>Chriſt loved</hi> me when I was <hi>wicked,</hi> and therefore I will <hi>love</hi> him, O! this is excellent.</p>
                     <p>The next thing I ſhould come to ſhew you is, how it comes to paſſe that Chriſtians that are right, are <hi>ſwayed,</hi> and ruled by <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reaſonings, all their life. I ſhall not have time now but muſt wait on God till he give another opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, only I ſhall conclude now with two ſhort <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Tryall what grace or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is in us.</note> Uſes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, hence you may ſee; by this rule you have a <hi>Standard</hi> by you to trie how much <hi>grace,</hi> and how
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:53448:204"/> much <hi>corruption</hi> there is yet in your ſoules; this is the <hi>perfecteſt</hi> Standard that I know. Take it by a <hi>day,</hi> or a <hi>weeke,</hi> or an <hi>houre,</hi> or an <hi>action,</hi> ſee how much in that <hi>action,</hi> or <hi>day,</hi> or <hi>houre,</hi> or <hi>weeke,</hi> thou art carried clearely upon <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reaſoning. So much of <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> ſo much of true, <hi>pure grace</hi> there is. Looke into thy life, and actions, <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>evill,</hi> that is not a jot matter, ſo much of thy life as is carried upon <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reaſonings, ſo much godlines there is. It is not how much thou <hi>faſteſt,</hi> or <hi>prayeſt,</hi> or the like, but how much thou art carried by ſpirituall <hi>reaſoning.</hi> As in <hi>Aegypt</hi> they have a <hi>Pillar,</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> upon it, and when <hi>Nilus</hi> flowes up, they know by thoſe <hi>Figures</hi> how farr the <hi>River riſeth,</hi> higher, or lower, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they ſet their <hi>rates</hi> on things, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly things will be <hi>dearer,</hi> or <hi>cheaper.</hi> Or as by your <hi>Weather-glaſſes,</hi> you know whether it will be <hi>raine,</hi> or <hi>faire</hi> weather. So this rule would be a <hi>Weather-glaſſe,</hi> a <hi>Grace-glaſſe,</hi> and a <hi>fleſh-glaſſe,</hi> that is, if thou lay up this in thy ſoule, hereby thou mayeſt know the <hi>ebbings,</hi> and <hi>flowings</hi> of thy <hi>ſoule,</hi> whether thou walke <hi>better</hi> this weeke then before. It may be luſt may drive a man to <note place="margin">Luſt may drive to good.</note> a good thing, but goe to ſpirituall <hi>rationality,</hi> that is the <hi>eſſence</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as the other <hi>rationality</hi> is the <hi>eſſence</hi> of a <hi>man.</hi> Hereby thou mayeſt know whither thou be <hi>nearer</hi> to God <hi>this</hi> weeke, then thou wert the weeke <hi>before,</hi> or whither thou be further from him.</p>
                     <p>The other leſſon, and a ſpeciall leſſon for you <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Why good men miſs the will of God.</note> to remember from what I have told you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>ſpirituall Reaſoning,</hi> is this, hence learne
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:53448:205"/> why <hi>wiſe men</hi> ſo oft <hi>miſſe</hi> the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> It is a bleſſed leſſon, why doe wee ſee <hi>godly</hi> men many times <hi>miſſe</hi> the will of GOD; and are quite out in matters of <hi>judgment,</hi> and <hi>action,</hi> and yet are <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>godly</hi> men: It is not becauſe they <hi>reaſon</hi> not <hi>rightly</hi> concerning ſuch things, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>reaſon</hi> whereby they reaſon it is more <hi>carnall</hi> then <hi>ſpirituall.</hi> As for inſtance, I could name a <hi>Booke</hi> that was Written about the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer,</hi> not long agoe, a Booke of admirable <hi>reaſon,</hi> full of <hi>rationality,</hi> and by a <hi>godly</hi> man too, and yet he <hi>miſt</hi> the will of God in it. How came it? Not becauſe he did not <hi>reaſon rightly,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>reaſon</hi> he <hi>reaſoned</hi> it by was <hi>naturall,</hi> and not <hi>ſpirituall.</hi> And ſo among <hi>Miniſters,</hi> they <hi>reaſon</hi> things throughly, and <hi>rightly,</hi> and draw <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions</hi> from them, but here they miſs, they look not what <hi>reaſon,</hi> they <hi>reaſon</hi> by; it may be it is <hi>naturall</hi> reaſon, and that may lead to <hi>naturalls,</hi> but it cannot to <hi>Spiritualls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a rare rule for Chriſtians, when thou art <hi>reaſoning,</hi> and thy <hi>thoughts</hi> are <hi>buſie</hi> about a caſe, and thou <hi>deducteſt</hi> one thing from another; but aske thy ſelfe, I reaſon, but what is this <hi>reaſon</hi> I reaſon by? is it <hi>carnall,</hi> or <hi>ſpirituall?</hi> As men that <hi>weigh gold,</hi> or other things, they firſt <hi>heave</hi> up the <hi>ſkales</hi> to ſee if they be right; we doe not doe ſo, and therefore we ordinarily miſs in this. As when a man is in <hi>anger,</hi> he thinks he never ſpeaks better <hi>reaſon</hi> than then; he ſpeaks <hi>powerfully,</hi> and he thinks every <hi>word</hi> is <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and every word is <hi>reaſon,</hi> but it is <hi>corrupt reaſon,</hi> and ſo it appeares to him the next day.

A man may ſay he can <hi>judge</hi> well of the <hi>colour</hi> of Cloath, by the light of a <hi>dark-ſhopp,</hi> but is that <hi>light</hi> right? a man ſhould examine that.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloved I would willngly end what I had to ſay to this text at this time, and I doubt not but by Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I ſhall doe it, and therefore I would but only lead you a little, becauſe we were driven to break off abruply that you may underſtand which way we have been going, when the Lord hath been teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us hitherto from theſe words.</p>
                     <p>I told you the Apoſtle in the 4. <hi>verſe</hi> had laid downe a great priviledge, and then he ſhewes who are the partakers of this priviledge; <hi>They that walke after the ſpirit, and not after the fleſh;</hi> but this is but <hi>generall,</hi> and therefore he ſhews it more particularly, by the <hi>beſt</hi> part of the man, the minde.</p>
                     <pb n="400" facs="tcp:53448:207"/>
                     <p>Beloved I have ſpoken a little in generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the minde, and to follow the Apoſtles method, I have <hi>culd</hi> out the chiefe thing in the <hi>minde,</hi> the chiefe act of it is the reaſoning. The minde, that is the reaſoning of the minde, from whence I have taught you this Leſſon.
<q>
                           <p>That, <hi>thoſe that are fleſhly, they are led, and ſwayed with fleſhly reaſoning, and thoſe that are ſpirituall, they are led and ſwayed by ſpirituall reaſoning.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>My end is to diſcover to you, whether you have this priviledge or no, and therefore in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles method, I would <hi>bolt</hi> it out as farr as I could. I told you <hi>man</hi> is a <hi>rationall</hi> creature, and no man doth any action, but there is ſome <hi>reaſoning</hi> about it, and though the <hi>action</hi> be never ſo <hi>ſuddain,</hi> yet the <hi>mind</hi> is ſo <hi>quick,</hi> that it hath ſome kinde of <hi>reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> or other.</p>
                     <p>Now for the explication, I told you there was <hi>three mindes, carnall, corrupt,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall;</hi> and from thoſe <hi>three minds,</hi> flowed <hi>three reaſonings, corrupt, naturall,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for the further proſecution of it, I told you there were <hi>three</hi> things I had to premiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, before I came to proove it.</p>
                     <p>One is, that there is the <hi>beſt reaſon</hi> in the world in <hi>godlineſſe, and religion;</hi> godlineſſe hath in it, all along, the excellenteſt, the beſt, the profoundeſt reaſon that can be, this I prooved at large: god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is not as ſome <hi>carnall</hi> people account it, a <hi>vaine giddy</hi> thing, but goes all upon <hi>reaſon,</hi> it is the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53448:207"/> 
                        <hi>act</hi> of reaſoning, as they ſay of <hi>Logick,</hi> and not like our <hi>naturall</hi> Logick from <hi>probabilitis,</hi> and the like; but it is all upon demonſtration: that's one thing I opened to you, and we had divers <hi>Uſes</hi> then, with which I will not now trouble you.</p>
                     <p>Now the ſecond thing I was to premiſe, was this,
<q>
                           <p>That the reaſoning of the ſoule, it is the higheſt act of the mind.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As I told you the <hi>mind</hi> is the higheſt <hi>faculty</hi> in the ſoule: ſo the <hi>reaſoning</hi> is the <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> and moſt immediate act of the <hi>minde,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the <hi>minde</hi> is the <hi>chiefeſt ſeate</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if he dwell there; or the <hi>chiefest</hi> garriſon of the <hi>Devill</hi> if he dwell there: So the <hi>reaſonings</hi> of the ſoule, are the chiefeſt <hi>weapons</hi> of the <hi>minde,</hi> becauſe I told you that theſe they doe come <hi>immediately</hi> from it.</p>
                     <p>The third thing was, that the <hi>reaſoning</hi> is the <hi>chief character</hi> of a man as <hi>reaſon</hi> in a man, conſidered in a naturall way, is the moſt proper way of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of him from other things, becauſe it is moſt eſſentiall to him; for you cannot diſtinguiſh a man ſo properly from a horſe becauſe he hath two leggs, and that a horſe hath foure, but by his <hi>eſſence,</hi> he is a <hi>rationall</hi> creature, and therefore I told you a man may know good excellently, a man may love good, and <hi>godlines,</hi> and a man may do good, and <hi>ſuffer</hi> for <hi>good,</hi> and yet be an <hi>hypocrite,</hi> yet be a <hi>carnall</hi> man. Why? Becauſe he may doe good and love good, and ſuffer for good, and all out of <hi>carnall reaſoning,</hi> he may love the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome fine circumſtantiall things.</p>
                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:53448:208"/>
                     <p>And therefore I concluded laſt day with two words of uſe, but I muſt endeavor to make good my promiſe. Now the laſt thing is, how it comes to paſſe, for I have as in reference to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine you heard, That <hi>ſpirituall men are ſwayed</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3. How it comes that Saints are guided by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall reaſon.</note> 
                        <hi>with ſpirituall reaſons.</hi> How comes it to paſſe that they are <hi>enabled</hi> ſo to reaſon, and to be ſo <hi>guided</hi> by ſuch <hi>Reaſons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beloved, in generall, certainly it is only by the ſame ſpirit of God, for I muſt advance the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> ſtill. Not in oppoſition to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me not, for the ſpirit takes of the things of <note place="margin">By the ſpirit.</note> Chriſt, and in the Scriptures, ſheweth you them; but it is the Spirits teaching you. And therefore it is ſaid they are <hi>after the ſpirit</hi> that <hi>doe mind ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things,</hi> becauſe it is the <hi>ſpirit</hi> that doth worke them to mind ſpirituall things, yee would never mind ſpirituall things elſe. All the <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the World, and all the <hi>wit</hi> in the World, will never teach a man to make one ſincere <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to doe <hi>good,</hi> or draw him from <hi>evill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, how doth the Spirit doe this?</p>
                     <p>Beloved, I told you heretofore that I doe not approove of thoſe that doe endeavour to ſhew you too particularly and disbiaſtly, how the ſpirit of God works in the ſoule, as many men have done, and many a godly man, but they have loſt much time, and have <hi>puzelled</hi> the ſoules of poore people, for thou knoweſt not how a <hi>Child</hi> is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the <hi>VVombe,</hi> how his <hi>eye</hi> is made, and how his <hi>Noſe</hi> is made. And how are we able to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver how the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God works <hi>grace</hi> in the <hi>ſoule,</hi>
                        <pb n="403" facs="tcp:53448:208"/> which ordinarily is done that he doth <hi>this</hi> firſt, and then that, and will not doe <hi>this,</hi> untill he hath done <hi>that,</hi> which hath brought forth a deale of <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie</hi> and needleſſe <hi>diſtinctions</hi> troubling the People of God.</p>
                     <p>But I will give you ſome particulars how he doth it. The wayes whereby he doth it, without <hi>curioſitie,</hi> not ſaying he doth <hi>this</hi> firſt, or <hi>that</hi> firſt.</p>
                     <p>He doth it by a <hi>Creation,</hi> by <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Creation, <note place="margin">1. By a creation.</note> he doth make a <hi>Caeation</hi> in the ſoule, which is called the <hi>new man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thou that art there now ſitting in the Pew, that <hi>creature,</hi> that <hi>old</hi> creature cannot reach the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God. It cannot be <hi>mended,</hi> for we have hearts of <hi>stone,</hi> that will not be cobled nor <hi>mended,</hi> but taken out wholly: our natures are ſo naught that they cannot be <hi>mended:</hi> but God comes, and by his Holy ſpirit makes a <hi>new Creature</hi> in the ſoule,</p>
                     <p>As <hi>man</hi> is ſaid to be a <hi>man</hi> and hath not his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination from the <hi>groſſer</hi> part, as his <hi>Legs,</hi> or the like; but from the more <hi>noble</hi> part, his <hi>ſoule,</hi> and his <hi>mind,</hi> for where as in one place it is ſaid, What will it <hi>availe a man, to get the World and looſe his ſoule;</hi> in another it is looſe <hi>himſelfe:</hi> So as my <hi>ſoule</hi> is my <hi>ſelfe.</hi> So there is an <hi>old man</hi> not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to outward <hi>age,</hi> but according to the <hi>inward.</hi> Now he makes thee a <hi>new creature,</hi> not <hi>New legs,</hi> and <hi>hands,</hi> but <hi>new mind, new affections,</hi> and new <hi>powers</hi> in thy ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Now moſt people ſay, that the Lord doth <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe new qualities</hi> into the <hi>ſoule,</hi> that whereas thou
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53448:209"/> haſt an <hi>under standing</hi> and it is <hi>rotten,</hi> and all is full of <hi>bad qualities,</hi> thou ſhalt have <hi>new qualities,</hi> thou ſhalt have an <hi>under standing</hi> that will mind <note place="margin">More then new qualities in Saints.</note> 
                        <hi>Heavenly</hi> things. Beloved, that is true, but I very much doubt whiter there be not ſomething <hi>more,</hi> becauſe the Lord calls it a <hi>man,</hi> and we never Reade in the Scripture where he will worke <hi>new qualities;</hi> but a new man. We are created a <hi>new Creature.</hi> Now that is the way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ever thou wilt be a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> man, thou muſt have the Lord to make thee a <hi>new creature.</hi> Now the Saints heretofore (pray underſtand me) did not looke upon things as we doe, we have had ſo many <hi>falſe diſtinctions,</hi> and ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions: we have not the ſame <hi>notions,</hi> and diſtinctions <hi>they</hi> had. They alwayes looked upon rhe <hi>inward</hi> man, or the <hi>new craature.</hi> Now we looke <hi>without,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> my <hi>inward</hi> man gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth dayly. If any man be in Chriſt he is a <hi>new Creature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beloved, that ye may underſtand this, beare with me a little, I doe find in the Scripture that a man is made a <hi>Saint,</hi> made <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and holy, <hi>two</hi> wayes.</p>
                     <p>One is by <hi>renewing</hi> a man to that which he was in <hi>Old Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, by <hi>creating</hi> things in him that were <hi>never</hi> there before. And we have theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions <note place="margin">A Saint made ſpirituall, how</note> in Scripture. <hi>Be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind,</hi> and <hi>created unto good works.</hi> So that a <hi>Saint</hi> he is made up unto that condition <hi>two wayes.</hi> Either God hath <hi>renewed</hi> in him thoſe things he had in <hi>Adam.</hi> Or elſe God hath <hi>created</hi> in him,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:53448:209"/> that which was <hi>never</hi> there <hi>before.</hi> As for inſtance, God revealeth in him <hi>Sobrietie,</hi> and <hi>continuance,</hi> and the like. Theſe things were in <hi>Adam,</hi> and now when a man is made a <hi>Saint,</hi> they are <hi>renewed</hi> only upon a <hi>new</hi> Foundation. And withall the Lord <hi>creates</hi> ſome things that were <hi>never</hi> in <hi>Adam;</hi> as for inſtance, he <hi>creates</hi> faith there, that is, the the <hi>faith of the Goſpell:</hi> There was a <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> without doubt; but that <hi>faith</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> to beleive in <hi>another,</hi> to <hi>renounce</hi> his <hi>owne</hi> righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, this was not in <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe it was point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blanke contrary to his owne condition, for he was to have <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> in <hi>himſelfe,</hi> and to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce</hi> it was <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>his</hi> condition. Now God Creates ſuch a <hi>faith</hi> in us.</p>
                     <p>And Beloved, there is another thing and it may be there are many things more. I have had many thoughts of it with ſubmiſſion to the <hi>godly,</hi> and wiſe, I thinke that Goſpell-goodneſſe, is a peice of the <hi>new man,</hi> which was <hi>not</hi> in <hi>Adam;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Some thing in Saints that was not in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                        </note> as to doe good to <hi>Enemies,</hi> to <hi>love them that hate us;</hi> to give <hi>drinke</hi> to a thirſtie <hi>Enemy;</hi> When one is <hi>wicked,</hi> and <hi>ungodly,</hi> and doth deale <hi>deſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> with us, as Chriſt ſaith, then to doe <hi>him good;</hi> and <hi>bleſſe</hi> when he <hi>curſeth,</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> for him that <hi>injureth</hi> us. Beloved, this is <hi>Goſpell goodneſſe.</hi> I have had many thoughts of it, had I time to proove that this <hi>Goſpell goodneſſe</hi> is a peice of the <hi>new Creature,</hi> that was <hi>not</hi> in <hi>old Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was <hi>goodneſſe</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> but not <hi>this;</hi> as for inſtance, there are diverſe things we find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Profeſſors</hi> that in the laſt day will be found to be nothing but the <hi>Old Adam,</hi> but <hi>Iſhmaells,</hi>
                        <pb n="406" facs="tcp:53448:210"/> that are <hi>humbled</hi> to the height, and ye ſhall ſee in them a great deale of diligence in Gods ſervice, but where will you finde a Profeſſor, one of 500. and I ſpeake with the leaſt, that you may clearly reade <hi>Goſpell goodneſſe</hi> in him; that you may ſay, younder is a man, that if you curſe him, he will <hi>love</hi> you, and if you doe him <hi>hurt,</hi> and that deſpitefully, he will <hi>pray</hi> for you. It is an eaſie thing to kindle a brand that hath been once lighted, to doe that which <hi>Adam</hi> did, but to doe this is a higher matter.</p>

                     <p>Then Secondly, he brings the ſoule to this way of ſpirituall reaſoning, by <hi>ſpirituall illumination,</hi> he created faculties before, and now he caſteth in light as he did in the <hi>old creation;</hi> you know he made Heaven and Earth in the lumpe, and then ſaid <hi>let there be light.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, the Lord will doe it by <hi>ſuggeſtion,</hi> that is, the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God puts <hi>light</hi> into the <hi>ſoule,</hi> he

When you are brought before Governours,</hi> it is <hi>not you that ſpeake, but the ſpirit</hi> of God that <hi>prompteth</hi> you.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the <hi>ſpirit</hi> doth it by <hi>Conviction,</hi> that <note place="margin">4. By conviction</note> is another way, we have it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. Saith Chriſt, when I <hi>goe, I will ſend my ſpirit,</hi> and my <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſhall <hi>convince the World of ſin; reproove</hi> you have it, he ſhall <hi>convince the World, of ſin, of righteouſneſſe, &amp; judgement.</hi> The word ſignifies, when he ſaith the <hi>ſpirit</hi> will <hi>convince,</hi> that is, by way of <hi>Argument,</hi> the meaning is, that in every <hi>carnall</hi> mans heart, there are <hi>arguments</hi> againſt <hi>faith,</hi> and for his owne deſtruction, and ſtrong ones too And when <hi>we Preach</hi> to you, ye bring <hi>reaſon</hi> againſt <hi>reaſon,</hi> and ſo goe away <hi>unconvinced, unconverted:</hi> but the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> will <hi>ronvince</hi> you, that is, he will bring ſuch <hi>strong</hi> arguments (as <hi>Doctor PRESTON</hi> ſaith) from Heaven, that will <hi>convince</hi> you. As when a <hi>ſtronger</hi> man commeth, he <hi>diſarmeth</hi> the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53448:211"/> other: as before we thought <hi>godlineſſe</hi> nothing but <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and <hi>Puritanſme,</hi> and the like; but now the <hi>ſpirit convinceth</hi> you, you ſee this is the <hi>only way,</hi> and out of this way I ſhall never <hi>ſee God,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>Another way I find the ſpirit doth it by, is, by <note place="margin">5. By comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration.</note> 
                        <hi>commemoration,</hi> by minding us of what we have <hi>heard,</hi> or ſomthing we have <hi>knowne</hi> before; it is our <hi>remembrance.</hi> Therefore ſaith Chriſt, I will ſend <hi>my ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>he ſhall bring to your remembrance,</hi> what you have heard, not that you ſhall remember a <hi>whole Sermon,</hi> and <hi>Repeate</hi> it every word; but thus it is, he will <hi>either</hi> ſuggeſt thoughts, <hi>Nene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> had before, or bring to our <hi>remembrance,</hi> a word we <hi>have heard</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Preacher,</hi> in ſuch a <hi>place,</hi> or <hi>Read</hi> in ſuch a <hi>place,</hi> or <hi>thought</hi> in ſuch a <hi>walke,</hi> or the like: and ſo ſetteth on, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the worke.</p>
                     <p>And he doth it by <hi>conſolation,</hi> he is the <hi>Comforter,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">6. By conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> the <hi>conſolation</hi> of <hi>the ſpirit.</hi> Beloved, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that ye know <hi>trouble</hi> of <hi>mind</hi> exceedingly hinders the acts of <hi>reaſon.</hi> That's the reaſon men are <hi>madd,</hi> becauſe ſome fumes riſe up in the <hi>braine</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> the <hi>mind,</hi> that they cannot reaſon, but are madd. Beloved our <hi>troubles</hi> of <hi>mind,</hi> and <hi>ſoule,</hi> they are like <hi>fumes</hi> that come up into the <hi>braine</hi> and <hi>distract</hi> us. A <hi>ſpirituall</hi> man is many times, as it were, a <hi>diſtracted</hi> man; there are ſo many fumes, ſuch <hi>horrour</hi> and <hi>guilt;</hi> that he is almoſt ſtarck mad; he can talke of <hi>naturall</hi> things, but in <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things he is, as it were, mad; the <hi>Chaine</hi> of <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reaſon</hi> is broken, and now the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,</hi> and he <hi>quiets</hi> the <hi>ſpirits:</hi> and when a man is
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:53448:212"/> in a <hi>quiet</hi> temper, the <hi>diſeaſe</hi> is gone and <hi>reaſon</hi> comes into the <hi>mind,</hi> and as the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſaid, ye know in <hi>naturall</hi> things, a man can <hi>reaſon</hi> when he is not <hi>troubled,</hi> ſo is it in the <hi>ſpirituall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another way is by <hi>ſanctification,</hi> by the ſpirit, <note place="margin">7. By ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> hee is the ſpirit of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> it makes the ſoule <hi>holy</hi> it takes away <hi>luſt,</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> from the ſoule. This I find in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 22. 23. I would open that place, but cannot, therefore pray conſider it: ſaith Chriſt, <hi>the light of the body is the eye, if therefore thy eye be ſingle, thy whole body ſhall be full of light.</hi> He doth oppoſe <hi>ſingleneſse</hi> unto evill, if thy <hi>eye</hi> be <hi>ſingle,</hi> that is, if thy <hi>eye</hi> be <hi>purged</hi> from all <hi>guile,</hi> that there is no <hi>ſin</hi> there, not when a man hath <hi>one eye</hi> to God, and the <hi>other</hi> to <hi>ſin,</hi> to the <hi>World.</hi> But if thy <hi>eye</hi> be <hi>evill,</hi> that is <hi>ſinfull,</hi> then <hi>thy whole body is full of darkneſſe.</hi> Therefore <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the pure in heart for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well Laſtly, there is another way, there are <note place="margin">8. By excerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</note> diverſe more, but I will name but one more. And that is, the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God doth <hi>teach</hi> the Saints thus to <hi>reaſon,</hi> by <hi>excerciſing,</hi> that is, helpeth them to <hi>excerciſe</hi> and <hi>improove</hi> that <hi>light</hi> that they have. There is a <hi>little</hi> light, <hi>naturall</hi> light, and there is a kind of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> light that an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> hath: but the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God doth <hi>not</hi> helpe him to <hi>improove</hi> that <hi>light,</hi> and therefore that <hi>light dyeth,</hi> he <hi>blowes</hi> not up the <hi>ſire,</hi> you know men come to <hi>reaſon,</hi> by <hi>reaſoning,</hi> and <hi>excerciſe</hi> of <hi>reaſon</hi> makes men ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, I mean makes them <hi>know</hi> how to <hi>reaſon.</hi> Now <hi>Hypocrites</hi> doe not thus, as you may ſee. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. There they <hi>knew</hi> God, and <hi>becauſe they glorified him</hi>

                        <hi>not as God, they became vaine in their imaginations,</hi> or in their <hi>reaſonings,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Originall, God gave them up to a reprobate mind,</hi> becauſe they glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied not God.</p>
                     <p>Beloved, I have three or foure uſes but I feare <note place="margin">

Therefore I will conclude with one word, and that is this. That from hence, from this that hath been ſaid, you may ſee what is the <hi>Fountaine</hi> of all <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> and of all <hi>evill</hi> in the ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Of all <hi>good</hi> as I have at large lookt upon it, but <note place="margin">1.

And ſo when men <hi>heare</hi> the Word of God, and <hi>forget</hi> it, they like it well; as a man doth, that ſees his face in a glaſs: but they goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and <hi>forget</hi> it, and whence is it? why <hi>James</hi> tells you, <hi>Deceive not your ſelves.</hi> Deceiving your ſelves; the word in the Originall is, by <hi>falſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings.</hi> A man heares the Word, and thinks ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am in this <hi>evill</hi> condition, and I am out of the way, and I muſt looke after Chriſt, and the like.
